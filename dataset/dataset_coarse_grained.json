        "article": "Israel Arms the World’s Autocrats—With Weapons Tested on Palestinians\n\n“The Palestine Laboratory” outlines how Israel sells its “battle-tested,” “field-proven” weapons and spyware to practically anyone, no matter how malevolent.\n\nIt was a genocide many of the world’s leaders tried to ignore. In spring 1994, under the cover of war, Hutu extremists in Rwanda began eradicating the neighboring Tutsi population, killing upward of 800,000 civilians and forcing around two million to flee the country. At the outset of this murderous 100-day campaign, the United Nations discouraged international involvement, labeling it an “internal conflict,” but as it became clear to the Western public what was occurring, many countries sent aid. That summer, President Bill Clinton, who had dragged his feet despite the local U.S. Embassy warning of impending massacres, finally asked Congress for $320 million in relief; and Yossi Sarid, Israel’s minister of environmental protection, arrived in Rwanda with a medical aid delegation to assist survivors. Sarid’s gesture, however, was “all for show,” according to journalist Antony Loewenstein, because “both before and during the genocide,” even after much of the world enacted an embargo, the Israeli government had sent weapons to Hutu forces—Uzi submachine guns and Galil assault rifles, grenades and ammunition, in several shipments worth millions of dollars.\nThis wasn’t the first time, nor was it the last, that Israeli weapons and tech fell into malevolent hands. In his searing account, The Palestine Laboratory: How Israel Exports the Technology of Occupation Around the World, Loewenstein examines Israel’s modern war exports to Augusto Pinochet’s fascist junta in Chile, the repressive Shah of Iran, the Guatemalan genocide (where the country’s right wing called openly for the “Palestinianization” of Indigenous Mayans), and, more recently, authoritarian regimes in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, India, and Azerbaijan, which earlier this year ethnically cleansed thousands of Armenians from its southwest.\nAs of 2022, the United States controlled an estimated 40 percent of the world’s weapons exports—nearly five times more than any other nation—but Israel, a desert country smaller than Massachusetts, also ranks among the world’s top 10 weapons exporters, in recent years boasting record increases in its market share, worth billions in sales. “Israel is almost unique among self-described democracies in not calling out or sanctioning atrocities worldwide,” Loewenstein observes. It sells to practically anyone, and has an unnerving sales pitch: Its gear is “battle-tested,” “field-proven”—assembled for use in the blockade on Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank and then sold around the world. Promotional tapes sometimes even use real-life video from drone strikes on military targets. Andrew Feinstein, an expert on the illicit arms industry, who determined one such film showed a number of Palestinian children being murdered from above, said, “No other arms-producing country would dare show actual footage like that.”\nWhen Loewenstein’s book was published earlier this year it received little coverage, but it has found new life amid the ongoing war. (The publisher, Verso, has made it free to download.) Because the situation in the Levant has changed so rapidly, some of The Palestine Laboratory is suddenly a touch out of date. (For instance, Loewenstein cites a 2021 Israeli poll saying most Jewish citizens “do not overly worry about solving the conflict with the Palestinians.”) Most of it, however, is dizzyingly prescient. In the West, Loewenstein argues, Israel is understood as a “thriving if beleaguered democracy,” allied with the United States against extremism, but look beyond the rhetoric and instead you’ll see a belligerent ethnostate with a vested interest in arming and training other belligerent ethnostates—a dark symbiosis upheld in the name of geopolitical necessity and economic interests.\n“Our friends can kill and maim with impunity,” Loewenstein writes, referring to friends of the U.S. and the U.K.: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel. On November 21, a hostage exchange agreement paused the Israeli siege of Gaza for at least four days, but the war’s end is far from visible. As people across the globe report feeling the world is becoming more dangerous, modern warfare industries have grown right along with the number of nativist governments, not to mention the refugees they spurn. Beyond its own project of so-called Palestinian containment, Israel considers its role arming the world’s autocrats and border agencies and producing spyware key to its continued existence, just as the technology itself helps other states achieve their own definitions of “security”—however bloody—in an ever destabilizing world.\nHow to summarize nearly a century of Zionist and Palestinian bloodshed and peacekeeping—of industrialization and expulsion, the birth of a “rules-based international order,” war, occupation, the dot-com boom? Loewenstein begins with his own story: He grew up in a “liberal Zionist” community in Melbourne—his grandparents had fled the Nazis in 1939, arriving in Australia as refugees—but he grew uncomfortable with both “the explicit racism against Palestinians that I heard and knee-jerk support for all Israeli actions.” This discomfort led him to the Israel “beat,” so to speak, which he has covered, living in Israel on and off, for more than a decade. “It made sense to view Israel as a safe haven in case of future strife for the Jewish people,” he remembers thinking, but one man’s safety was another’s death knell.\n“It’s either the civil rights in some country or Israel’s right to exist,” said Eli Pinko, the former head of Israel’s Defense Export Control Agency, in 2021. “I would like to see each of you face this dilemma and say: ‘No, we will champion human rights in the other country.’” Under this ethos, the Israeli economy quickly “abandoned oranges for hand grenades,” as one critic memorably quipped. After the Six-Day War in 1967, when the 19-year-old nation launched a preemptive strike on its neighbors—taking over the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights—a new era in Israeli politics began. The actions set the country, Loewenstein says, “on a military path that has never stopped,” though, to be fair, Israel wasn’t the only one. Just six years before, Dwight Eisenhower had warned of the dangers of an American military-industrial complex in his farewell address. It would be a mistake to consider that clunky term as merely representing a national problem. Instead, these two complexes, American and Israeli, developed interdependently within a broader system.\nArm in arm with them was South Africa. Some pundits bristle when critics compare modern Israel to the old apartheid state, arguing that the particulars are different. What’s undeniable, however, is that in the 1970s Israel cemented a military and security agreement with South Africa that endured secretly for decades. Anton Liel, the head of Israel’s foreign ministry desk in South Africa in the 1980s, wrote recently that Israel “created the South African Arms industry” and, in turn, South Africa helped finance Israel’s technology: “When we were developing things together we usually gave the know-how and they gave the money.” This partnership enabled Israel to develop its nuclear arsenal, Loewenstein says; it became the only country in the region with its own nuclear arms. (Despite pleas from nonproliferation groups, the U.S. lets Turkey hold around 50 of its nukes, within spitting distance of Russia and Iran.)\nIsrael was the last nation in the world with strong ties to the apartheid regime. An old South African government yearbook explained what bonded the two countries “above all else”: Both are “situated in a predominantly hostile world inhabited by dark peoples.” Decades later, caught on a hot mic, Netanyahu echoed the sentiment in a meeting with far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán: “Europe ends in Israel. East of Israel, there’s no more Europe.”\nIn the same conversation, Netanyahu admonished the European Union, Israel’s greatest economic partner, for placing milquetoast conditions on trade to incentivize peace talks with Palestinians—conditions that hadn’t stalled the EU’s increased reliance on Israeli border technology but were nonetheless, to Netanyahu, a slap in the face. Indeed, for whatever pearl clutching may exist among some European politicians about how Israel treats Palestinians, the EU had little trouble justifying the use of Israel’s border tech against migration from Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan. More recently, countries like Germany have boosted their weapons sales to Israel to support its war effort. “Palestinians were the guinea pigs for Israeli technology and surveillance,” Loewenstein argues, and the EU viewed these containment tools “as an achievement to be copied in its own territory.”\nSo has the U.S. Today, Israeli surveillance tools on our border with Mexico (and Guatemala’s border with Honduras) are used to choke out migration from Latin America. Indeed, post-9/11, Israel became a kind of North Star for many U.S. policies. In late November 2001, the CIA drafted a memo on the “Israeli example” as a possible basis for arguing “torture was necessary.” It was also among the 20-plus countries that helped transport “war on terror” detainees to CIA black sites.\nThat said, the relationship between the two countries is more contentious than many realize. Leaks from the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden illustrate this: In the 2000s, for instance, at around the same time the NSA was sending the Israeli government private emails and phone calls from Palestinian and Arab Americans—leading relatives who lived in occupied Palestine to potentially “become targets,” as Loewenstein writes—other documents show that agents believed our alliance was “a constant challenge,” “arguably tilted heavily in favor of Israeli security concerns.” Given the U.S. security state’s fervor after 9/11, this state of affairs stung. “Nevertheless,” the report continues, “the survival of the state of Israel is a paramount goal of US Middle East policy.”\nAdditional top-secret documents listed Israel as the “third most aggressive intelligence service against the US” (emphasis mine), grouped in with China, Iran, Russia, and reflecting growing U.S. concern with Israel’s cyberwarfare capabilities—and that “trust issues” plague the two agencies’ relationship. To this day, we continue to exclude our so-called “greatest ally” from the “Five Eyes” alliance between the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K., an intelligence-sharing compact Loewenstein calls “the most secretive and intrusive” in the world—perhaps for good reason.\nIn November 2021, the Biden administration took a rare step by blacklisting two Israeli surveillance firms, the NSO Group and Candiru, that have deep ties to the Israeli state. NSO in particular, and its spyware, Pegasus, which can remotely and covertly harvest essentially everything on your phone, had fallen into hot water upon being traced back to the brutal assassination of Jamal Khashoggi (the Saudis purchased Pegasus with the approval of Israeli authorities in 2017) and the persecution of journalists and human rights activists around the world. While Biden’s move was welcome, Loewenstein remarks, the likely reason behind it was that “an Israeli company was encroaching on American technological supremacy.” Ironically, NSO recently hired a new lobbyist in Washington: Stewart Baker, a former general counsel of the NSA.\nIf you know where to look, the alliance between our two countries appears deeply strained despite claims to the contrary, and yet a certain harmony remains. The Palestine Laboratory is an invaluable primer on how the West enables Israel’s occupation and weapons sales, how Israel enables the West’s border-fortifying spree, and the careful policing required—both discursive and literal—to maintain this balance, where no one but our enemies are deemed hostile and our friends get away with brutality practically unscathed. (Loewenstein shows too how Israeli surveillance companies meticulously track social media, pressuring companies like Facebook to censor keywords like “resistance” and “martyr.”)\n“The worst-case scenario,” Loewenstein writes in his conclusion, “is ethnic cleansing against occupied Palestinians, or population transfer, forcible expulsion under the guise of national security.” Today, we’re witnessing exactly that, with (at the time of writing) more than 11,000 killed in Gaza and an ongoing evacuation of its northern region ordered by Israel. On Wednesday, after reaching a brief truce with Hamas, Netanyahu told reporters it was “nonsense talk” that the fighting would stop after hostages were returned, emphasizing that this was merely one of many “stages” of the war. In mid-November, in what we might consider an addendum to his book, Loewenstein appeared on Democracy Now! to discuss the ongoing war. “Israel is already, as we speak … live-testing new weapons in Gaza,” he said, likely referring to a new laser- and GPS-guided mortar bomb called “Iron Sting,” manufactured by the Israeli firm Elbit Systems—the same company that, with government approval, helped militarize the U.S.–Mexico border, armed Myanmar’s military junta even after its violent coup, and supported Azerbaijan’s ethnic cleansing with state-of-the-art drones.\nOur friends, to put it simply, have been busy.",

        "article": "The Shocking Antisemitism After Hamas Attack Is Deja Vu All Over Again\n\nFor those who know American history, all of this has happened before.\n\nIt’s truly shocking to see on college campuses such vicious anti-Semitism and support for Hamas’s brutal, violent attack on Israel — in which Hamas barbarians murdered, tortured, raped, and beheaded men, women, and children, including babies.\nBut it is not surprising. Given the Marxist, socialist training camps that our universities have become, especially “elite” schools like Harvard Law School, where the editor of its law review was videotaped verbally and physically assaulting a Jewish student on campus, what else would anyone expect?\nAs Prof. Charles Lipson of the University of Chicago accurately says, the “neo-Marxist faculty” who have taken over these institutions strongly support “militant Muslims.” That support is reflected in many of the anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian student organizations like “Students for Justice in Palestine” that want Israelis exterminated and have come out in full support of the sadistic terrorism of Hamas.\n“This is the most hostile environment Jewish students have ever faced in America,” Lipson says. He’s right.\nBut for those who know American history, all of this has happened before. These pro-Hamas, anti-Semitic groups, many of which are organized by ethnic Palestinians, are just like the infamous German American Bund of the 1930s. As the Holocaust Museum explains, the Bund was “an organization of ethnic Germans living in the United States” that supported Nazi Germany and was “fueled by antisemitism.” Sound familiar?\nThe German American Bund (the word in German means “federation”) “carried out active propaganda for its causes, published magazines and brochures, organized demonstrations, and maintained a number of youth camps run like Hitler Youth camps.”\nAgain, doesn’t this sound familiar? Just look at the propaganda being put out by pro-Hamas groups at college campuses all over the country; their support for a terrorist organization; and the anti-Israeli, anti-Jew hatred being spread by students and professors. Or at the Stanford instructor who labelled his Jewish students as “colonizers,” said the Hamas terrorists were “freedom fighters, and blamed Hamas’s murderous attack on \"Zionists.” Or the Chicago professor who called all Israelis “pigs,” “savages,” and “irredeemable excrement” who should “rot in hell.”\nBlaming the Jews for everything that has gone wrong in Gaza? We’ve seen that before, too.\nHamas’s tyrannical rule over Gaza sounds remarkably like the 1930s in Nazi Germany. An executive summary of a U.S. State Department report notes that Hamas, which exercises dictatorial control over Gaza, uses its “military wing to crack down on internal dissent.” The report lists the “significant human rights” abuses of Hamas in Gaza including:\narbitrary killings by Hamas personnel; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by Hamas personnel; arbitrary arrest or detention; political prisoners or detainees; serious problems with the independence of the judiciary; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including violence, threats of violence, arbitrary arrests or prosecutions of journalists, censorship, and criminalization of libel and slander; serious restrictions on internet freedom; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; serious and unreasonable restrictions on political participation; serious government corruption; lack of investigation of and accountability for gender-based violence; crimes, violence, and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism; unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers; crimes involving violence and threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons; and the worst forms of child labor.\nIf we didn’t know this was from a 2022 State Department report, we would think it was a 1939 State Department report about Nazi Germany.\nAnd speaking of 1939, in February of that year, the German American Bund held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, attended by 20,000 people. This was six years after Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. The pogroms against German Jews and the virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazis were well-known. Concentration camps in which the Nazis were imprisoning political opponents, union leaders, and many others had been running since 1934. And Germany had already invaded and annexed Austria and the Czech Republic.\nThese so-called Americans of the Bund knew what brutish thugs the Nazis were. Yet they supported them anyway until the U.S. entered World War II, when the organization was outlawed by the government. The American, pro-Hamas cohorts know what Hamas is doing and has done both internally in Gaza and in its relentless terrorist attacks, and yet they actively support this cruel organization that the State Department in 1997 classified as a terrorist organization. Hamas killers even wore bodycams to record their terrible, heartless deeds of inhumanity, so none of its American supporters can claim ignorance of their barbarism.\nDean Erwin Chemerinsky of the Berkeley Law School says that “never” in his life has he “seen or felt the antisemitism of the last few weeks” that erupted after the Hamas attack on Israel.\nThe fact that it is happening again in America and that we have active organizations, just like the German American Bund, should scare us. We have to stamp this out now before it spreads even further and gets out of control like a wildfire.\nThat starts with school administrators, the media, government officials, Hollywood, and others no longer making excuses for the vocal supporters of Hamas. They should be criticized, condemned, and prosecuted when they engage in violence and threats, and made to suffer the personal and professional consequences of what they are doing, including losing jobs.\nIf they were members of the Nazi Party or the Ku Klux Klan, that would be happening. Purveyors of Jew hatred and supporters of terrorist groups like Hamas are no different.",

        "article": "America Has Been Completely Sold Out Not Only By Our Braindead POTUS But Both Parties Of Congress, With The Huge Majority Of Republicans As Despicable And Odious As Democrats\n\nGiven the wholesale disaster that has been the Biden presidency, one has to wonder how it all happened. We have all seen the Democrat party become radicalized, almost purely Marxist, since the Obama administration. Obama promised to transform the country and he surely did. He effectively drove race relations backward by seventy years.\nIt is common knowledge that Obama despised his VP Biden. Why he was chosen to be his VP in the first place is anybody’s guess. Biden was a known jerk, a racist (his mentor was KKK member/aficionado Robert Byrd), rather dumb, a plagiarist, and a pathological liar. For example, for years he told the story that his first wife was killed by a drunk driver. That was never true; the accident was her fault and the truck driver was not intoxicated. He enjoyed humiliating Clarence Thomas throughout Thomas’s confirmation hearings when in fact, Biden is not fit to shine Thomas’s shoes.\nSo the question remains, with a president so obviously an intellectual lightweight to say the least, a man who is now obviously suffering from advancing dementia, how is it that Biden has been able to do so much damage to the nation. Answer? The Democrat members of Congress are stupid, greedy, and addicted to power. It is more important to them to retain that power than to do the right thing; adding insult to injury, most Republicans are as equally self-serving and incompetent. Those with both brains and the courage of their convictions can be counted on two hands. The rest do as much harm to the country as the Democrats.\nBiden’s list of failures is long and well-known, from the Afghanistan withdrawal to provoking Putin to invade Ukraine, to interfering with Israel’s war against Hamas; these are just some of the lowlights. The biggest and most egregious catastrophe is the open border and his standing invitation to any and all foreigners who can afford to make the trip (they all pay the cartels and coyotes). The nation has been invaded, our demographics permanently altered, by perhaps as many as ten million unvetted persons from 170 countries. NYC and Chicago have been destroyed. Denver, a sanctuary city, has been overrun, its hospital in breakdown mode. Most homes and ranches on the border have been ruined. Homeowners find dead bodies on their land. If they defend themselves against criminal migrants, it is the homeowner who is arrested.\nThe world is upside down. Our legal system is upside down, backwards and corrupt. The left wants and has generated total chaos throughout the land. How? Our leadership, members of Congress, and much of our judiciary is thoroughly corrupt. They use their power to advance their political agenda without regard for the law. The absurd political persecutions of Donald Trump prove that. They vote to fund wars because they get rich when there is war.\nThe Democrats want the open border because they want more Democrat voters. They do not distinguish between legal and illegal. The Constitution no longer means anything to the left nor does it to the RINOS who are Democrats-lite. They vote for what benefits them, not for what is right for the American people. The so-called “border bill” passed in the Senate proves that. It merely codified what has been going on for three years—thousands of illegals crossing the border every day. That bill is an insult to U.S. citizens; it assumes we are all morons. The bill just included more millions of dollars for “processing” those thousands of illegal migrants they are admitting. But the left has nothing but contempt and fury for those who do not support the open border. They want cheap labor; the latest jobs report shows that all the new jobs have gone to foreigners.\nThe Democrats at least present a united front. They vote how they are told to vote. They would be sorely punished if they failed to do as they are told. The Republicans on the other hand, the majority of them, are weak-willed, easily manipulated, and think that virtue-signaling is one’s greatest character trait. The few who voted not to impeach the odious Mayorkas are idiot virtue-signalers. The man has flagrantly flaunted the immigration laws on the books. They vote against any definition of common sense and claim they are the righteous ones. They are pathetic as are the twenty-two Republican senators who voted for spending another $95b, $66b of it to Ukraine. God bless those who voted against it. That money does not exist! It will have to be borrowed or printed, added to the $34t the U.S. already owes. They all know this. They know that Zelensky is a fraud, a tool of the oligarchs, and that Ukraine has lost the war that never should have begun. The only explanation for their votes is personal gain. Clearly none of them are good at math despite their Ivy League educations.\nMeanwhile, the value of the dollar is falling fast. The BRICS countries are fast devaluing American currency. Every one of those twenty-two Republicans is a traitor to their constituents. American tax dollars are pouring into projects that only harm Americans and help migrants and criminals who are allowed to roam the streets to shoplift and freely commit violent crimes for which they suffer no consequences. That’s the game the Democrats play and there are not enough courageous Republicans to thwart them.\nThe obvious reason that members of Congress vote the way they do when it is counter to what their constituents want is that they are paid! Paid by donors, lobbyists, and other special interest groups or individuals. George Soros comes to mind. Everyone knows that Mitch McConnell is a Chinese asset due to his Chinese wife’s family’s shipping business. As with Joe Biden, that relationship has made him very rich. There is likely a similar story, to one extent or another, for each member of Congress who votes for himself or herself without a thought for the people they are there to represent. Nothing else explains the terrible damage done these past three years.\nWho are the good guys? Sen. Ron Johnson, Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Jim Jordan, Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Rep. Matt Gaetz, Rep. Matt Rosendale, Rep. Eli Crane, Sen. Blackburn, Rep. Andy Biggs; there may be more but these are the ones who are unafraid to speak for the people. These are the members who are generally mocked and derided by the mainstream media for being… wait for it… “right-wing radicals.” But they are the members of Congress who can do the math and know that the irresponsible spending has to stop or the country will be economically over.\nBecause there has been no audit, no one really knows how the billions already handed over to Ukraine were spent. We do know that the corrupt oligarchs there, Biden’s pals, have purchased mansions in Russia and Egypt and yachts that are docked in Monte Carlo. There are rumors that the weapons sent are being sold on the black market throughout Europe. We know there are bio-labs there and that orphaned children are being trafficked. Why then do so many members of Congress want to send more billions to a lost cause? ‘Tis a mystery. But arrogance, stupidity, and greed seem the most likely answers.\n",

        "article": "A Panoramic Extravaganza Of Everything That's Gone Wrong: Driving Us To An Apocalyptic Climax Because Our Political Leaders Can't Stop Lying As They Burn The Whole Country Down\n\nIt's Long Past Time The Entire Biden Crime Cabal Is EXECUTED For Treason\n\n“It’s like every other two-minute clip I watch of this Fani Willis interview she admits to committing another felony.” — Senator JD Vance (R-OH)\nHave you noticed yet that America has turned into a Coen Brothers movie? Everywhere you look, you see madcap characters disgracing themselves while doing their bit to burn the whole country down. It’s a panoramic extravaganza of everything gone wrong, with slapstick overtones, driving toward an apocalyptic climax — civil war, nuclear war, economic collapse, maybe all three. And all because the people on-screen just can’t stop lying.\nThis past week was Fani Willis’s turn, her big scene. The Fulton County, Georgia, DA, wasn’t even scheduled to testify, but she barged into Judge Scott McAfee’s courtroom and seized possession of the witness stand like it was home-base in a game of ringolevio. This was after the morning vivisection of her boyfriend, the feckless Nathan Wade, testifying to the couple’s fun-filled romantic travels during the months they were supposedly busy constructing a racketeering case against Donald Trump and eighteen others scooped into their dragnet.\nThe reason the lovebirds could take so much time cavorting across the Caribbean and California — vineyard tours featuring “pairings of champagne, chocolate, and caviar,” Ms. Willis testified — is because their Fulton County case was entirely prepped for them out of DC by Mary McCord, the veteran blob lawyer active in every Get-Trump hoax cooked up since 2016. (And I’d bet cash-money that she had plenty of assistance from Lawfare blobsters Norm Eisen and Andrew Weissmann.) The complex particulars of the case were all teed up, ready to go. All Ms. Willis and her lead prosecutor, Mr. Wade, had to do was get the trial date set, raise the curtain, and follow the script.\nAlas, the couple got carried away in the raptures of amour and, all of a sudden, we’re in something like The Real Housewives of Atlanta. And then they lied about the details under oath, especially around the money involved. If they are not disqualified from participating in the Trump “racketeering” case — in which their own behavior would be centerpiece evidence of an ineptly tainted and malicious prosecution — and/or if the case is not tossed summarily, then it will have to be removed to another county and most likely delayed until after the 2024 elections. Nice work, Party of Chaos!\nThat little opéra bouffe is but one sub-plot in the larger scenario. Also this past week, the scandal of the century was re-kindled when alt-news reporters Taibbi, Shellenberger, and Gutentag filed the story of how Barack Obama and CIA Director John Brennan, with his chore girls, Avril Haines and Gina Haspel, cooked up the RussiaGate caper and fed it to the FBI, with a major assist from The New York Times, the WashPo, CNN, and other useful idiot news media vectors. All of this had actually been well-documented for years, but the reporters dredged up new corroboration from disgusted blob insiders further clarifying the origins of the hoax.\nThe cast of characters in that part of the big movie has been consistent through eight full years of anti-Trump hysteria and the associated trips laid on our country. Ms. McCord, for instance, was U.S. Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security during the birth of RussiaGate; later served as counsel to the House Committee that kicked-off Trump Impeachment No. 1 (coordinating the Eric Ciaramella “whistleblower” scam); then became counsel to Rep. Bennie Thompson’s J6 committee investigation, and now turns up as Fani Willis’ legal tutor, and probably also tutor to New York State Attorney General Letitia James and her preposterous Get Trump real estate valuation case under Judge Engoron. (Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA on the Stormy Daniels case against Mr. Trump, was coached by then US Associate Attorney General Matthew Colangelo who was hired out of the DOJ directly into Mr. Bragg’s office for tutoring purposes.) All of this coaching post Jan 20, 2021, was coordinated by the “Joe Biden” White House.\nSpeaking of whom, the evermore spectral “president” was not having a great week either after DOJ Special Counsel Robert Hur painted him into a corner in his final report as either too demented to face charges in the purloined documents case (and, by inference, not mentally capable to be president), or else a criminal trafficking in top secret documents he was not authorized to possess as Senator and Veep. Looks like that puts an end to “JB’s” game of pretending to run for reelection (that is, lying about it) and leaves the Democratic Party holding a flaming bag of dog doo-doo.\nIn the background of all these shenanigans in high places lurk three other smoldering bonfires: 1) all the lying, deception, and treason behind the Covid-19 operation that has left more than half the country susceptible to deadly vaccine injuries (and disordered our society); 2) the monumental mail-in ballot fraud of the last two elections (2020, 2022) enabled by the Covid-19 “emergency”; and 3) the War in Ukraine which is winding down towards another US humiliation, and behind which lurks a virtual off-gassing giant landfill of money-laundering, bribery, and something that smells like treason. Also looks like BlackRock will miss out on the colossal asset-stripping op it has been looking forward to there.\nOh, and by the way, this movie is not over. A lot of the people involved are going to end up in court themselves, perhaps in prison. Stay in your seats.\n",

But then other governments got in on the action. Wikipedia nobly asserts that,\nAfter the Soviet term became widely known in the 1980s, native speakers of English broadened the term as \"any government communication (either overt or covert) containing intentionally false and misleading material, often combined selectively with true information, which seeks to mislead and manipulate either elites or a mass audience.\"\nSo, in the 1980s, experts agreed that disinformation was a government thing.\nBut now all the best people at the Atlantic are worried about Substack, which is “unwilling to remove avowed Nazis from its platform.”\nBut are the avowed Nazis committing “misinformation” or “disinformation” or “malinformation?” How would we know? How could we tell?\nFortunately, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency has the whole thing covered and defined with comprehensive and mandatory definitions of “misinformation” and “disinformation” and “malinformation.” And naturally, our liberal friends and their miasma of NGOs -- led by the noble ADL and the SPLC -- are doing their bit to winkle out the bad guys. The SPLC recently helped the FBI horn in on dangerous radical Catholics practicing the Tridentine Mass.\nBack in the day, of course, our liberal friends were all worried about government propaganda, what with Joe McCarthy’s lies about Communists in the State Department and the U.S. government’s lies about Vietnam. Now they are worried about nongovernmental liars.\nI call that a “tell.”\nBack in the day our liberal friends knew that the United States was the great implacable force in the world that was the main obstacle to the Left’s fight for justice and peace. Back then the left saw itself fighting against government power. Today the tables are turned. Now it is “avowed Nazis” on Substack that are standing in the way of the progressive government’s multicultural movement for justice.\nIn other words, back then the Left experienced itself gazing up helplessly at the battlements of imperialist America. Today it is standing on the battlements of Working Class America looking out at the threatening swarm of annoying deplorables down below.\nHow dare those peasants appropriate the means of communication that, all good people know, should be reserved for the use of educated and evolved people! The idea of “avowed Nazis” polluting the means of communication with their racist-sexist-homophobia is simply “unsafe.”\nIn other words, the world has changed, and our liberal friends can’t stand it.\nBut what exactly has gotten our liberal friends into such a panic? I have an idea.\nBack in the day only the best and brightest got to publish ideas -- in books, and newspapers, and magazines -- and there were gatekeepers all along the line to keep things under control.\nBut now it’s a complete free-for-all. Any local yokel can start up a Substack site. As the Substack About page says,\nSubstack is something new: a subscription network… A few hundred paid subscribers can support a livelihood. A few thousand makes it lucrative.\nAnd there are no gatekeepers. You can be up and running on Substack in minutes. It’s a complete free-for-all. For the first time in history. Just ask Bari Weiss.\nSo let us tell the three ages of the History of Communication.\nAge of Parchment: Writers write, monks in monasteries create illuminated manuscripts by hand in their monastic cells. Gatekeeper: The Abbot.\nAge of Gutenberg: Writers write, printer’s devils convert the written word into print. Gatekeeper: The Editor.\nAge of Free-for-all: Writers write, and press Publish. Gatekeeper: The… (oh no!)\nInformed by my History of Communication, we now know what our liberal friends are feverishly working on today.\nWe need new gatekeepers! To keep the Narrative pure! To stop Disinformation before it destroys Our Democracy! To head off “avowed Nazis” at the pass! To prevent “harm” to traditionally marginalized peoples! To stop the Latin Mass before it destroys America! To call out “climate deniers!” To banish TERFs from the university!\nI get it. How are we going to send the doughboys to Europe unless President Wilson can control the Narrative about German attacks on “passenger and merchant ships in 1917?” How can the U.S. prevail in Vietnam if left-wing and anti-war protesters get to disrupt the 1968 Democratic convention? How are we going to fight World War COVID if anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers spread distrust of government medical experts? And how are we going to save the world from runaway climate change unless “climate deniers” are well and truly deplatformed for their denial of The Science?\n\"There is nothing more urgent, as the nation goes to the polls this year, than to stop the out-of-control Disinformation produced by far-right extremists and influencers on the free-for-all internet with licensed and bonded and DEI-approved Gatekeepers\" they think and babble to themselves.",

Charter. It is ‘We the Peoples’ who are embarking today on the road to 2030.”\nHowever, Americans know that those opening words appeared well before the U.N. Charter, as they are (sort of) the opening words of the U.S. Constitution. When the U.N. was founded, the endearing word “rights” — so important in our republican form of government — was used repeatedly in its first documents. In the present lead document, the word “rights” is used only once, and here the opening phrase of our Constitution is blithely claimed as belonging to the U.N. Perhaps these egotists believe that their Charter is to be considered the beacon of light for the world’s nation-states.\nThe U.N. through its present Agenda hopes to implement a worldwide power-grab for itself over every sector of planetary life as it expressly takes it upon itself to provide for the meeting of worldwide “needs” and ”sustainability.” Our Constitution, based on a profound study of the history of government by many of the founding fathers of the USA, wanted to build a longstanding viable system based on rationality, biblical moral values, the need for stability, and the proper balance between local and federal needs and concerns.\nThey sought to learn from the mistakes of the past, and they believed that power should be shared between private entities and the government. The idea of a federal monolith such as we have today was far from their minds, and even farther was the idea of an international monolith superseding even the monolith we have now.\nThe U.N., with its megalomaniacal vision claiming international authority over sovereign nation-states, then writes in the same Section 52, “Our journey will involve Governments as well as Parliaments, the U.N. system and other international institutions, local authorities, indigenous peoples, civil society, business and the private sector, the scientific and academic community — and [you the reader will not be surprised by the last item] all people.”\nBusiness? The private sector? Indigenous people — yes, friends, that means even the decisions of tribes in remote jungles. Local authorities? Could it be that even the placement of stop signs is on the horizon line of the U.N. vision? And why do they bother capitalizing the words “Governments” and “Parliaments”? This writer would suggest that this is their pea-brained attempt to show respect to the nation-states they are now ready to supersede in authority.\nCooperating with this vision of international governance, the Biden administration is now trying to manipulate the U.S. into signing onto a treaty that will expand the authority of the World Health Organization thereby to some degree encroach on our health policy rights. Further, there is the fundamental question of whether or not we can participate in such a “treaty” without a two-thirds vote of the U.S. Senate whereas the Biden administration position is that we can treat a sign-on as an agreement by piggy-backing the agreement onto previous treaties that were already ratified by the Senate.\nThis is not unlike the Iran Agreement, signed in 2015 during the Obama administration. It actually should have gone to the Senate for a treaty vote of two thirds, but through the efforts of Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who downplayed the dangers of the deal, it was treated as an agreement and never came to a vote. This writer will forever wonder what kind of “deal” the Obama administration made with Corker to dilute Republican voting to require a two-thirds vote in order for the “deal” to pass.\nIn the next to last sentence of Section 52, the writers suddenly and unaccountably make an appeal to popular support as justifying the envisioned power-grab over the world. They state, “Millions have already engaged with, and will own, this Agenda.” “Millions have engaged with”? Has anyone in the world voted for this Agenda? How have they “engaged”? And millions “will own this Agenda”? This incredible rhetoric comes out of the blue and is not written elsewhere in the document. It is an injection of sophomoric fantasy — baseless, in fact, and useless in a policy paper that claims ultimate governmental authority.\nWhat if I suddenly said, “I am going to take control of the government of my city, and when I do, I will improve every lawn and garden in the city”? And then what if somebody said, “What if you are not elected to do this?,” and I in turn said, “I did not say ‘I am asking to be elected,’ but said ‘I am going to take control’”? In effect, that is what Agenda 2030 is retorting to any who might object to its positions and premises.\nThe last sentence of Section 52 must leave any American reader shaking his head. It reads, “It is an Agenda of the people, by the people, and for the people — and this, we believe, will ensure its success.” Here, the writers quote from the last sentence of Pres. Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. They are likening Agenda 2030 to the fight engaged in during our Civil War or the exalted vision on which the USA is based. No one has fought and died for Agenda 2030. Or perhaps they are remotely hinting that many will die if Agenda 2030 is not implemented? Or perhaps it is nonsense that was composed by someone at the U.N. who was high on some substance and just liked the sound of the words? At the risk of being accused of hyperbole, Lincoln’s quoted phrase has more substance to it than this entire 2030 document.\nSection 52 in so many ways reflects the bizarre and useless mindset behind Agenda 2030. It takes timeless phrases out of context. It shares a vision of authority and power the U.N. does not legitimately possess, and by its distortions and stupidity positions Agenda 2030 as one of the most repulsive documents of all time.\n",

        "article": "Western Govts Are The Biggest Threat To Humanity With America's 'Leaders' Lawless Tyrants, Waging War On God, The Bible, Christianity, The Rule Of Law And The American People\n\nNEVER Give Up Your Guns To Tyrants Who Want To Kill You\n\nThere have been murmurs for at least the last ten years about the potential for civil war in the United States. Polls have shown that roughly half the country believes that future conflict is likely. The intrusion of unchecked government power into every crevice of our private lives has transformed politics into a high-stakes cage match in which furious citizens fight to survive. Because government exerts so much control over citizens, winning control of government has become an existential imperative. Such zero-sum thinking has fractured society and pitted Americans against one another.\nHowever, something fundamental has been shifting beneath our feet. If you look at how civil conflict has been discussed on websites and internet forums over recent years, a noticeable trend emerges. Talk of “civil war” between various coalitions of states transformed into calls for “independence” from tyrannical government on par with America’s 1776 founding. In turn, calls for an American-style “revolution” against government abuse have transformed into the kind of rage against a “permanent ruling class” that existed before the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror.\nThis shift is significant. “Civil war” connotes a feeling that Americans will be fighting one another. A “1776-style struggle for Independence” reflects a belief that the federal government must be brought to heel. Widespread discussions of how to rid the country of an unaccountable bureaucracy with more allegiance to fellow globalists from the World Economic Forum than to fellow citizens from America’s heartland reveal a growing recognition of and antipathy for an entrenched ruling aristocracy.\nGovernments don’t mind when citizens quarrel. In fact, that old “divide and conquer” scheme is Washington’s favorite tactic for keeping Americans too busy fighting one another to notice what kind of mischief is going on in D.C. Governments would prefer that citizens not speak about “freedom” or “liberty” because those ideas are antithetical to bureaucratic mandates, institutional power-grabs, and rhetorical appeals to authority. Still, so long as an Orwellian news media establishment and a Machiavellian political class can work together to impugn “liberty” as “selfish” or “hateful,” then the powers that be largely succeed in twisting the meaning of “freedom” into a love for Big Government policies or a patriotic subservience to the State. However, when ordinary people begin to set aside their differences and instead turn their fury toward those holding the reins of power, well, Katie, bar the door — trouble’s brewing!\nThere is an understandable tendency to look at the growth of government-directed censorship, warrantless surveillance, and political persecution as proof that Americans will soon be under the yoke of full-fledged totalitarianism. That is a real and threatening possibility. However, petulant and steel-booted policies meant to terrorize and dishearten citizens also reflect a growing fear among the “ruling elite.” You do not spend three years hunting down patriotic grandmas and selfless veterans who attended the J6 protest for free and fair elections unless you are terrified that a critical mass of people sees rampant election fraud as a Uniparty weapon for maintaining illegitimate control. You do not set up “disinformation” review boards or pretend public debate is a “threat to national security” unless you are frightened of what ordinary people have to say. You do not spy on people’s financial transactions, text messages, and social media posts unless you view every single American as a danger to the State. Rapid technological advancements have given government authorities unsavory tools for pursuing unconstitutional, illegal, and immoral policies against the American people, but those authorities would not be so openly hostile to the public or flagrantly dismissive of their constitutional obligations if they were not already afraid.\nThey should be. The single greatest social transformation in several centuries is occurring right now. A transnational consensus is growing among ordinary citizens that coercive government is dangerous wherever it exists.\nNo longer does a Cold War mentality successfully corral national populations into an “East vs. West” or “Us vs. Them” cognitive prison. Western governments that conveniently partition the world into “democracies” and “autocracies” betrayed their own distinction when they imposed COVID policies as brutally stringent as those of any communist dictatorship. No longer do our puppeteers successfully divide us into two opposing camps — one fighting unrestrained government power and the other fighting unrestrained corporate power. The illusion of self-government has been shattered, and a broader public appreciation has taken hold that recognizes the convergence of financial and political interests at the expense of democratic principles and human rights. No longer are those most eager to profit from the death and destruction of war capable of flipping a switch to turn patriotic citizens into willing sacrifices for a “ruling class” that never seems to have common people’s best interest in mind. Decades of costly wars with questionable strategic aims, battlefield betrayals, the moral ambiguity of occupying foreign lands, the resettling of millions of foreigners into our homelands, and the constantly shifting definition of which nation, group, or tribe is now the “enemy” have all produced much more discerning civilians unwilling to die for Bill Kristol’s, Hillary Clinton’s, Nikki Haley’s, or Liz Cheney’s next call to arms.\nThe U.S. and other Western governments know this to be true. It is why the United Kingdom’s new “Online Safety Act” criminalizes the publishing of “false information,” unless that false information is coming from mainstream media corporations. It is why the European Union’s “Digital Services Act” seeks to stifle public debate on social media platforms. It is why the U.S. Senate is pushing through legislation ostensibly meant to protect children from online threats and to protect adults from the dangers of Chinese propaganda that will nonetheless be used to censor “politically incorrect” and un-“woke” points of view from the internet. It is why the Biden administration is funding A.I. research programs that can be used to seek and destroy government-defined “misinformation.” It is why the White House successfully pressured Amazon to suppress the sale of disfavored books. And it is why political figures across the West had a conniption fit when they discovered that Tucker Carlson was conducting a journalistic interview with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Such is the state of free speech in the West that a panoply of petty tyrants representing America, the U.K., and continental Europe all called for Carlson to face severe punishment for having the temerity to engage in unsanctioned journalism. The blurry line between “democracies” and “autocracies” has vanished.\nThis should not have to be said, but no society can be described as “free” unless that society can engage in free speech. Likewise, there can be no free speech unless the public is free to criticize and disagree with the government. Any government that claims a monopoly to determine what is true is a government hostile to dissent, debate, and democratic self-rule.\nWestern governments have so betrayed their duties to act as custodians of Enlightenment-inspired human rights that they have become as tyrannical as the tyrants against whom they posture. They are now little more than a collection of feudal lords using the trappings of their offices to enrich an insular “ruling class” while impoverishing and diminishing the masses.\nThrough a lot of unnecessary pain and discomfort, national populations have discovered this hard truth for themselves. “Green energy”–induced inflation has cut a hole in every struggling citizen’s pocket, while “green energy”–inspired regulations have devastated the livelihoods of every worker. “Green energy” zealots have targeted Western farmers, miners, laborers, and machinists for cancelation. The World Economic Forum’s “green new world order” seeks to eliminate private property, private communications, private transportation, and private transactions. The heart of human freedom is on the line. And, increasingly, Western populations are concluding that Western governments and corporations deserve the blame.\n",

        "article": "America Is Reaping The Whirlwind We Have Sown: As Our Nation And Leaders Embrace Satan & Globalism While Sacrificing The American People, Destruction & Deception Thrive\n\nRecently, I wrote a message titled “Babylon the Great Is Fallen.” In that message, I erroneously stated that “Mystery Babylon” was mentioned in Revelation 18. Since that time, I’ve done a much deeper study on the subject and there are some things I’d like to clarify here.\nFirst of all, “Mystery Babylon” is not mentioned in Revelation 18, but specifically in Revelation 17. “Mystery Babylon” describes the “great whore,” upon whose forehead was written “Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.”\nAs I have learned, this “Mystery Babylon” is the coming one-world religion... a false religion, worshiping false gods. A great abomination. As we read in Revelation 17, this “woman” that John saw in his vision was “drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.” So, Revelation 17 describes “Mystery Babylon” as spiritual Babylon — a coming together of false religions from all over the world; as I said, a coming “one-world religion.”\nThis spiritual “Mystery Babylon” is already coming together; indeed, already in place. You would do well to study on the topics of the “Parliament of World Religions,” or the “World Council of Churches.” Here in Wisconsin, we have the “Wisconsin Council of Churches,” a branch of the “World Council of Churches.” But these are not Christian churches; they’re apostate in every respect. They advocate for everything God considers an abomination, under the guise of “Christianity.” Be not deceived by them.\nLast year, the Parliament of World Religions held their annual meeting in Chicago. The event opened with a thing called “Sacred Fire: Greeting the Day Prayer and Fire Offering.” Other sessions during this conference focused on “Bhawana Yog - Guided Meditation.” Many sessions were held addressing the topic of combating “Climate Change,” there was a session called “Seed The Earth Altar in the Women’s Village,” a session was held titled “Going Beyond Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.” And not to mention the one titled “The Spear Within - The Staff is Passed to the Feminine.” And these are just a few of the sessions on the first day of the five-day event.\nThe entire convention was replete with sessions on feminism, climate change, pagan rituals, globalism, earth worship — honoring “Mother Earth,” esteeming science over sound theology, “interspecies justice,” which dealt with the worship of animals, transgenderism, homosexuality, and I could go on. Over 8,000 people attended, from more than 95 countries, representing more than 210 different religions.\nPlease understand, that the entire premise behind “Babylon” has always been a one-world order, a one-world government and one-world religion. In other words, as we know it today, “Globalism.” But God Almighty does not embrace “globalism.” He destroyed the tower of Babel and the city of Babylon because it was wicked, and sought to deceive people, drive them away from the one true Creator of the universe, and ultimately Jesus Christ, our Savior. But that spirit of Babylon is rising again in today’s world — at an alarming pace.\nToday, spiritual Babylon of Revelation 17 is being established through things like the “Parliament of World Religions” and the “World Council of Churches.” Not to mention, the Roman Catholic pope, standing hand-in-hand with Islam, even as he endorses homosexuality and transgenderism. We also have the modern American churches, most of which have become apostate as well, with a “form of godliness but denying the power thereof.” “Making the Word of God of none effect,” through traditions, trends and tactics designed to simply fill the seats by pastors using “soft words,” that tickle itching ears.\nNo doubt, a one-world religion is coming. The leadership of the World Economic Forum has even suggested that a new “proper” Bible may soon be written by Artificial Intelligence. No doubt, this “new Bible” will be all-inclusive, mixing the pagan with the holy, or removing the holy altogether as it will likely teach we must worship and serve created things, rather than the Creator.\nBut we should also be mindful of Revelation 18, which describes “Babylon the Great.” This is no mystery. This is economic Babylon — yet still described and named “Babylon,” and still representing Globalism, a “new-world order,” a “one-world system.” After the one-world religion is destroyed by God, the economic system of “Babylon the Great” is next.\nWe read, “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit...for all nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.”\nHere, Babylon the Great is about to be destroyed by God. But John hears another voice from heaven saying, “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues.” These exact same words were used in Jeremiah 51, when God warned His people to leave the city of Babylon before He destroyed it. God always warns His people of coming judgment. Through Noah, He warned the people of the world that some might be saved, yet only eight people were. He also warned the Israelites prior to sending the death angel to Egypt. He warned Lot and his family before the destruction of Sodom. He is warning us today.\nI don’t know for sure if Babylon the Great is a city, as Scripture tells us, or if it represents a nation. If it is a city, it will likely be the headquarters of the New World Order, now being assembled by the Globalists. But whether a city or a nation, it’s a place of great arrogance toward God, with no reverence for God and in fact, a disdain for God. It’s a place — or a system — where the people rely on their riches, their luxuries and their comfort, and rather than honoring and serving the one true God, they think themselves to be gods. It’s right out of Satan’s playbook — using the same tactics he used against Eve in the garden — “you shall be like gods.”\nToday, so many are just as arrogant, if not more so. And we’re seeing the characteristics of this “Babylon the Great” of Revelation 18 in the institutions now wielding power over all the world: the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization, the United Nations — all seeking the dissolution of national sovereignty, the destruction of national borders, the centralization of power and control, and “building back better” after they destroy it all.\nBut this new world order, this “Babylon the Great,” that the Globalists are building will come to an end in one day. Indeed, in one hour. “And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,\n“Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour is thy judgment come. And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more.”\nLet’s read on: “The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, (can you say “Bill Gates” — or “Pfizer?”) shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, and saying, ‘Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!”\nRevelation 18 goes on to describe Babylon the Great’s complete and utter destruction. I believe we’re reading about the destruction of the Globalist New World Order system. A system of tyranny, deception and absolute domination and control by the Globalist so-called “elites.” We also read, “...thy merchants were the great men of the earth; and by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.”\nIt's important to note here that the word “sorceries” is correctly translated “Pharmakea” — drugs, chemicals, mRNA “vaccines,” jabs. All nations have already been greatly deceived by the COVID planned-demic. Now, they’re planning for “Disease X,” which they tell us they don’t know what it will be, yet they’re already developing a new “jab” to treat it. How convenient. No “warp speed” needed this time. Now, they’re developing the next “jab” to treat an illness that doesn’t yet exist. And people are buying into this — because they are deceived.\nRegarding the destruction of Babylon the Great, verse 20 tells us, “Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.” And then verse 24, “An in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth.”\nFriends, the United States may or may not be “Babyon the Great.” As I study these Scriptures more and speak with learned Bible scholars, I’m convinced it will be the headquarters of the New World Order. Still, the United States, I believe, will receive a similar judgment of God. We’ve committed all the crimes of Babylon the Great, whether you realize it or not.\nI believe there are 197 countries in the world today. The United States sends foreign aid to 180 of them. Are you aware, that in order to receive this foreign aid, all of these countries must accept, push and promote two things? Those two things are: homosexuality and abortion. All nations that accept our foreign aid (via our tax dollars) are required to promote homosexuality and abortion — with the exception of Muslim nations. They receive our money with no strings attached.\nThis country used to be a lighthouse on a hill, sending missionaries to the uttermost parts of the earth to share the Gospel to all nations. We used to defend the oppressed and help the poor. Now, many of the missionaries we send are spreading the same false gospel they preach in our modern American churches. A friend of mine once met with a missionary from Africa, who came here to visit, and this man begged us to stop sending missionaries because the missionaries were apostates — preaching a “different gospel” than that of the Holy Scriptures.\nWe’re no longer defending the oppressed or helping the poor. Now, we’re sending them drugs, pornography, homosexuality, transgenderism and war instead. We have become the oppressors, for the benefit of the money our politicians can make from them.\nAnd now, we’re reaping the whirlwind we’ve sown, as we live under a tyrannical regime that imprisons its political opponents, that has destroyed our national security and defense and has instigated an invasion by foreign enemies. We export sodomy, homosexuality and transgenderism, we kill, rape and abuse our own children sexually, physically and mentally. We give lip service to advocating for the dignity of women, but then declare that males can be females, if they choose to be. We declare that 50-year-old men can masquerade as 15-year-old girls and join their swim team; and change clothes and shower with them too. Because now, 50-year-old men can “identify” as 15-year-old girls and if you think or say otherwise, that’s “disinformation.”\nSurely God has sent us strong delusion. Surely this nation is guilty of sinful pride and arrogance. America has blood on its hands from the sacrifice of our own children to Molech under the guise of “women’s rights” through abortion; through instigating the devastation of war around the world, and the lies of the “official COVID hospital protocols” that would have made Hitler and Josef Megele proud.\nSo many in our land have fallen for great deception. But as I stated, God always warns His people. He always makes a way of escape before He pronounces judgment and destruction. I pray that many will open their eyes today, awake from their stupor and turn back to God. Open that dusty Bible, get on your knees and pray and seek His face and turn from your wicked ways. You know what your own personal transgressions are. Face them, repent from them, and turn back to God. The Globalist Babylon is coming; we can’t escape it. But we can be rescued from it and rejoice when God Himself squashes all the plans and schemes of the wicked kings of the earth in just one hour’s time. Understand the times we’re living in, warn others, stand strong and don’t back down.",

        "article": "With America’s Behavior Under 'Braindead Biden' Becoming Increasingly And Dangerously Unhinged, All Of Western Civilization Is Now Engaged In A Mystifying Act Of Mass Suicide\n\nThere are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen\n\n“Putin confirms: ‘The United States is not run by its elected officials.'” The Vigilant Fox on “X”\nHistorians of the future, gathered round their campfires poaching armadillo tail-flaps in their own shells, will harken back to the wondrous day in 2024 when they could watch and compare two heads of great nations present themselves to the world for assessment. There was Mr. Putin of the land called Russia, calmly discoursing in fine detail on a thousand years of his country’s history. And there was Mr. Biden of the USA, facing the White House press pool, angrily refuting a special prosecutor’s glum conclusion that the President was not mentally competent to be tried in court on the finding that he’d indeed mishandled classified documents.\nThe contrast between the two figures might even alert the mandarins of our Ivy League that something has gone very wrong in this country for a decade or more, and could arouse suspicions among the faculties that they had been gulled into a false view of our recent history. Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report issued Thursday said it rather plainly:\nIn his interview with our office, Mr. Biden’s memory was worse. He did not remember when he was vice president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended (“if it was 2013, when did I stop being Vice President?”), and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term began (“in 2009, am I still Vice president?”). He did not remember even within several years, when his son Beau died. And his memory appeared hazy when describing the Afghanistan debate that was once so important to him.”\nThe disclosure raises not a few uncomfortable questions. If Mr. Biden’s declining mental condition was apparent to federal attorneys interviewing him — admittedly not top psychologists — then wouldn’t the same picture present itself to the scores of busy assistants and subalterns busy toiling with the president around the clock for three years in the White House? Not to mention the myriad other government officials, agency heads, corporate nabobs, and news media notables streaming through the Oval Office every hour of the day? And yet, every last one of them has gone along with the pretense that Mr. Biden is doing just fine and is capable of running for reelection. Weird, a little bit.\nIf there has been any discussion about Mr. Biden being in possession of the so-called “nuclear football,” the briefcase full of launch codes for our arsenal of missiles and bombers, it has gone unnoticed in the press. I suppose a conspiracy to suppress that chatter would be labeled a “conspiracy theory,” which also suggests that Mr. Biden’s mental deficiencies have somehow infected the entire body politic of the USA. That is, much of the whole US population is mentally unwell, living in a national hall of mirrors. How did that happen? Is it possible that there are branches of our government dedicated to driving the population crazy. . . a kind of ordeal-by-gaslight?\nThat impression was only reinforced by listening to the president of our supposed adversary, Russia, Mr. Putin, in his confab with independent journalist Tucker Carlson. For one thing, Mr. Putin dared to express the likelihood that somebody, or group of somebodies, must be secretly running the executive branch of America’s government behind the mentally vacant figurehead “President Biden,” but Mr. Putin would not venture to guess who that might be.\nWhat Mr. Putin displayed most of all was an air of prudence, an awareness that America’s behavior has become increasingly and dangerously unhinged over the years he’s been in power, requiring much delicacy and Christian patience not to worsen. Ukraine was at the center of the discussion, of course, since it has become a point of dangerous geopolitical inflammation.\nIt is unclear whether the American audience was able to follow Mr. Putin’s detailed disquisition on the history of Ukraine, and how lately it eventuated in America’s bungling effort to wrest it out of Russia’s sphere of influence. He explained his view of events around the “Maidan coup” of 2014 and NATO’s repudiation of the Minsk Agreements that might have satisfactorily ended hostilities and provided a framework for reestablishing Ukraine’s status as a neutral borderland between Europe and Asia.\nMr. Putin also confirmed my own conjecture: that, after the Fall of the USSR, Russia had one overriding concern in foreign relations: to be re-admitted to the European family of nations as a once-again “normal,” member, especially in trade relations, after seventy-five years of its peculiar communist experiment. He spoke of this quite ruefully as a lost opportunity to shore up Western Civilization — now engaged in a mystifying act of mass suicide that Russia decidedly wishes to opt out of by strategically reorienting with the BRICs bloc.\nThis Friday morning, the USA is fraught with events unspooling. As I write, with dawn just breaking, there is almost zero opinion yet formed about these troubling matters on the vast Internet — but it will probably come in hot-and-heavy as the day ticks on. If Mr. Biden is truly mentally incompetent, as established more-or-less legally by Special Counsel Hur, then there is the obvious remedy of the 25th amendment — removal of a president for reason of disability. A debate over this would seem unavoidable now. The question also implies that Mr. Biden’s charade of running for reelection must come to an end. What will the Democratic party do about that?\nA not inconsiderable part of our Ukraine problem has been that our chief executive was for years engaged in bribery and money-laundering misadventures there, for which there is abundant and powerful evidence, meaning he may have had very personal interests in keeping that country disordered — and sending billions of dollars there, some of it surely embezzled among the Zelensky government. You’d have to also be aware that the bag-man in those operations, the President’s son, Hunter, might well have misbehaved with drugs and prostitutes on his many trips to Ukraine as a board member of Burisma. Hunter’s self-compiled archive of round-the-world drug-fueled porn recordings on the laptop that (the FBI confirmed recently) was unquestionably his own, suggests that the Ukraine authorities may have their own recordings of him behaving similarly, or worse, and are using them to blackmail “President Joe Biden.”\nWe will also learn the judgment, probably with remarkable dispatch, of the Supreme Court in the matter of Colorado kicking Donald Trump off the election ballot. Meanwhile, the case against Mr. Trump in Fulton County, Georgia, is falling apart in DA Fani Willis’s pathetically comical scandal, now with a new “love nest” twist (paid for with public money). And Judge Engoron and AG Letitia James might be weighing the fates of their reputations in the shabbily-conducted and bogus real estate valuation fraud case against Mr. Trump, which will eventually be vivisected at some level of appeal. The old saying remains powerful: There are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen.",

        "article": "While Much Of America Sees Biden As The Feeble & Decrepit Puppet Democrats Used To Steal The 2020 Election And Carry Out Mass Genocide, Leftists Sink Deeper Into Psychotic Delusions\n\n'Operation Dump Joe' Keeps Growing Louder\n\n“We are going to have the most diverse and inclusive civilizational collapse in history” — Oilfield Rando on “X”\nHark! We were informed on President’s Day by The New York Times that a poll out of the University of Houston, led by one prof of poly-sci named (get this name) Brandon Rottinghaus, ranks “Joe Biden” at No. 14, way above average among the forty-six demi-gods elected to run the US government since 1789. It’s a helluva good bit of news for a nation in need of reassurance in these dark days, don’t you agree? They’ve got him sandwiched between John Quincy Adams and Woodrow Wilson, beating out the likes of Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, James Monroe, and Ronald Reagan. Mr. Trump is ranked dead last, of course.\n“Biden’s most important achievements may be that he rescued the presidency from Trump, resumed a more traditional style of presidential leadership and is gearing up to keep the office out of his predecessor’s hands this fall,” the report states.\nGearing up? I’m sure. If gearing up means calling a lid on your life an hour after breakfast. And what do you suppose they mean by “a more traditional form of leadership.” Arranging serial overseas military humiliations? Selling favors to all comers from foreign lands? Inviting transsexuals to cavort on the White House lawn? Abolishing control of US borders? Running a $2-trillion annual deficit? Mandating unsafe and ineffective so-called “vaccine” shots on millions? Cancelling the First Amendment? Stealing elections? Conspiring to jail his political adversaries?\nWe’re also informed in recent days by the Department of Justice that “Joe Biden” is not mentally competent to answer for anything in a court of law, should someone inquire into the signal irregularities emerging from the fugitive annals of his long career. Of course, “Joe Biden” running for reelection is one of the greatest gags ever put over on the American public. But more astounding yet is that half the country persists in pretending to believe it. They are egged on in every possible way by persons in high places of government fearful of going to prison if the Democratic Party loses its grip on the levers of power.\nSince “Joe Biden” is not actually calling the shots, one naturally wonders who is responsible for all the dubious achievements of the past three years. I guess we’ll find out when Mr. Trump wins that election in November, an outcome increasingly guaranteed unless “Joe Biden” (or, let’s face it, our Intel Community) takes the final decisive step of bumping off the Golden Golem of Greatness. What have they got left? AI-contrived photos of Mr. Trump having sex with a manatee in the intercoastal waterway off Mar-a-Lago?\nIn New York City, the Woke lunatics did a victory dance after Judge Arthur Engoron, beaming his Joker smile, laid a $350-million fine on Mr. Trump for conducting a set of normal real estate transactions with a bank that profited from doing business with him. Many are still trying to figure out how that amounts to a crime of any sort. Don’t suppose that the check is in the mail, though.\nThere is an appeals process that leads, you may be sure, to a dismissal of that inane judgment and the puerile hypotheticals that the case derived from. And, by and by, you also might expect a countersuit for malicious prosecution when all that smoke clears. New York Attorney General Letitia James, lacking impulse control, is for the moment enjoying the fulfillment of her campaign promise to “get Trump.” Waiting to see how much she enjoys losing her law license in the days to come.\nEvery reaction provokes an equal and opposite reaction, Newton’s Third Law states. It manifested shortly after Judge Engoron’s end zone dance when a call went out over the Internet for America’s truckers to refuse loads inbound to New York City. We’ll have to stand by to see how that develops. No more bok choy, Texas beef, or Meyer Lemons for you, “progressive” denizens of the Five Boroughs! Embrace the suck!\nThe genius part is that, unlike the 2022 Canadian truckers’ action in Ottawa, the American truckers will not be cluttering up New York’s streets with their rigs, license plates on view, leaving them vulnerable to such pranks as the shutdown of their bank accounts. All they’ll do is sit innocently at home back in Kentucky and Missouri, enjoying a break from the rigors of the highway. Is that a crime? Arguably no more than doing a normal real estate deal in good faith with a willing lender was a crime.\nThe truckers have promised to include Washington DC next in their delivery boycott. The K-Street lobbying gang won’t be buying any influence for a while over platters of grilled branzino and Mariscos Molcajete. Maybe there will a few Cliff Bars left in the Farragut Square 7-Eleven and they can do business in their cars. As for “Joe Biden,” his minders have probably laid in enough Ensure for a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory to get by for a few weeks — until the magic moment when, alas, he needs to be thrown under the bus of expediency to keep their game going.",

        "article": "Two Videos Show 'The Big Picture': China's Master Plan Relied Upon Treasonous US Politicians Who'd Put Illegal Aliens Ahead Of Americans & Would Foot The Bill For Our Deaths & Destruction\n\nChina Is Waging War Against America From Inside The U.S.\n\nTo truly understand what's really happening in America right now, it's crucial to take a look at two different videos out in just the last few days that both give us alarming warnings, but when looked at combined, give us 'the big picture' that we'll never get from the talking heads in the mainstream media, nor from our 'government overlords,' who are working overtime to destroy America.\nWith the first video featuring Ohio Sheriff Richard K. Jones holding a press conference after meeting with Sheriffs all across the country, along with the head of the FBI, Christopher Wray, and Jones warning Americans that there are more red flags right now of something HUGE ahead than there were before 9/11, and Sheriff Jones highlighting the alarming number of Chinese, military-aged men that 'Terrorist-In-Chief' Joe Biden has allowed in to our country through our wide open southern border, as the Conservative Playbook warns in this new story, 'evil Democrats have opened the door to chaos'.\nAs ANP has been reporting for well over a year now, while the nation of China is over half a world away, for some strange reason, a huge number of people that 'terrorist Biden' has been allowing in have been fighting age Chinese men, and while that may seem to be an 'oddity,' as the Gatestone Institute warns in this new story, there is nothing odd about it once you realize this is actual Chinese military strategy on how to defeat and destroy America, tactics that come straight out of a 1999 book titled \"Unrestricted Warfare: China's Master Plan To Destroy America\" that was written by two Chinese air force colonels.\nArguing within their book that China should employ ANY TACTIC at all to attack what they labeled as a 'militarily superior America,' as the American Thinker reports in this new story, we're witnessing that right now as China's waging war against us this very moment, and from INSIDE THE USA, thanks once again to 'terrorist-in-chief' Joe Biden and those pulling the strings behind him.\nAnd with that Gatestone Institute story warning us bluntly that China's infiltrators are here for one reason and one reason alone, and that reason being to kill Americans, it perfectly laid out for us how the Chinese Communist Party has put that infrastructure to slaughter Americans into place, and thanks to Joe Biden, they're doing that from within the USA, on Joe's watch, and with US taxpayer dollars.:\n- [I]n Reedley, California, near Fresno, authorities found a secret Chinese biological weapons lab with at least 20 pathogens, including the one for Ebola, and almost a thousand mice that had been genetically engineered to spread disease.\n- Chinese agents, in addition to hobbling Americans with disease and gunning them down, could bomb power stations, attack military bases, start wildfires, poison reservoirs, or create terror in dozens of ways.\nAlso warning us that these Chinese attackers are already here in America, with more and more arriving every day, while showing us videos that have been posted to 'X' showing these illegally arriving Chinese migrants firing guns, including one of a Chinese female with a sniper rifle, please keep all of that in mind when you take a look at the 2nd video we've discussed that helps to tell the 'whole story,' new video footage featuring a press conference given by Denver Mayor Mike Johnston where he announces that many city programs will be ended to provide more money for illegal immigrants. That video thus providing even MORE PROOF Democrat politicians have put illegal aliens ahead of the American people.\nAnd think about EXACTLY what that means when you understand these people who Denver's mayor is putting ahead of his own residents have come here to kill us. If Democrats get their way, the American people are footing the bill for our own deaths and destruction.\nWith that video featuring Ohio Sheriff Richard K. Jones seen in the 1st video at the bottom of this story while the video featuring Denver Mayor Mike Johnston is seen in the 2nd video at the bottom of this story, both combined giving us the 'big picture' that we'll never get from the mainstream media, and that Joe Biden and Democrats/RINO's all across the country have set up America for a GIGANTIC terror attack in the days ahead, there can be little doubt any more that we're witnessing nothing less than the planned destruction of America, enabled by our own public servants in Washington DC and in states nationwide.\nAnd as Sheriff Jones bluntly warns us, while those Sheriffs all across the United States of America have been seeking out meetings with our 'terrorist in chief Joe Biden' to discuss these dire issues, Biden has shown his true colors by refusing to meet with them. Think about that! Biden wants nothing to do with America's top law enforcement officials! Yet back in November of 2023, Biden was more than happy to meet with China's Xi Jinping in California!\nThink that China didn't know about Biden's diminished mental capacity?! Just think about the DAMAGE that China could do knowing that! We can hear that conversation now if we listen closely enough between Xi and Biden: \"You just let us kill off 200 million Americans, Joe, and we'll be happy to slide over $200 million to Hunter. Just don't tell anybody... you senile old fool....wink wink.\"\nAnd the fact alone that Biden won't meet with US Sheriffs but is more than happy to meet with China while allowing in an endless flow of illegal aliens/terrorists gives us even more proof of what we warned about just days ago on ANP in this story titled \"By Failing To Abide By His Constitutional Duty To Protect The USA, Joe Biden OWNS The Next Terrorist Attack Upon America - Open Borders Are 'Big Business' For Those Here To Kill Americans - Border Invasion Is Biden's Plan To Create A One-Party State And Complete The Destruction Of America.\"\nSo why would Biden TOTALLY NEGLECT his Constitutional Duty to protect the United States from foreign invaders UNLESS he was 'in on' the coming attacks upon us? The mere fact alone that Biden hasn't been hung yet for this obvious treason tells us his entire chain of command is participating in this destruction of America because if there were any true 'rule of law' left, they'd all be swinging in the gallows. The excerpt below comes to us from this previously referenced Gatestone Institute story.:\nIf you had just landed somewhere as a migrant with nothing to your name, you would undoubtedly be preoccupied with finding your next meal, getting a place to live, making a livelihood.\nYou would not, within weeks of entering your new homeland, be sharpening your skills to kill.\nYou would not be thinking of killing unless... that is what you came to do.\nThe videos posted on X depict a sandy location. Blaine Holt, a retired Air Force general living in Idaho, knows Chinese migrants are taking target practice in his state as well.\n\"Tens of thousands of military-age men have come across our border and are now in America, organized by group and nationality\" Holt told Gatestone this month. \"Among them are terrorist and state actors, in particular, members of the People's Liberation Army of China. As we speak, these actors are training, making plans and obtaining weapons, watching our patterns, and learning our vulnerabilities.\"\n\"We are vulnerable to attack,\" Holt added. \"Our enemies eagerly wait.\"\nWar correspondent Michael Yon and the Rubin brothers of Muckraker.com have documented the presence of dangerous-looking elements — from China, Iran, Syria and Venezuela — among the hordes of migrants traveling up from Central America. Yon and the Rubins have noticed, among other things, that Chinese males of military age are traveling in packs of five to fifteen, are unaccompanied by family members, and are pretending not to speak English. Some of them, on their way to America, have performed Chinese military rituals.\n\"What are these guys doing here?\" Holt asked, referring to the Chinese migrants honing their shooting skills. \"They are coming here to kill us.\"\nAnd with these people who are here in America here to kill us at the invitation of Joe Biden and his criminal supporters in the Democrat party, the 'big picture' we're seeing is one of rot to the very bone, US politicians all across the country setting up Americans to be killed, quite literally eliminated, while the American taxpayers who are being killed off are quite literally providing the funding for 'our replacements'.\nIn the 3rd and final video at the bottom of this story, the previously mentioned Michael Yon joins Mike Adams with bombshell revelations about the NGOs orchestrating this MASS INVASION of America.\nWarning us that all of this will have a major impact on both crime and security all across the country as more and more of these people with plans of waging war upon us and killing us are allowed in, we're also warned that drug cabal's are rushing in as quickly as they are able to spread more death and destruction across the country through getting American children hooked upon their drugs, quite often the incredibly deadly fentanyl.\nAnd all of these deadly drugs being fast-tracked into the US doesn't even take into account all of the bioweapons labs that have sprung up all across the country, such as this one in Reedley, California, where authorities had found a secret Chinese biological weapons lab with at least 20 pathogens, including the one for Ebola, and almost a thousand mice that had been genetically engineered to spread disease.\nAs this Gatestone Institute story warns, \"there are no benign explanations for such a facility.\" Bluntly warning within that story that this labs most likely purpose was to create biological pathogens that could be used to 'exterminate' Americans, we'd guess that it's highly unlikely China has only one such lab here in America. So how many more are operating to this day at full capacity? We'll never know under the reign of terror of Joe Biden.\nAnd with the country now likely overflowing with Chinese agents thanks once again to the wide open southern border, as the Gatestone Institute story also warns, ALL of this, everything we're witnessing, was laid out in that 1999 book Unrestricted Warfare, a 'how to manual' on how to destroy America.",

        "article": "Under Democrat Rule, America Has Become A Failed State: Thus This 'Terrorist Government' That Bludgeons Families & Butchers Our Children Must Be Destroyed & Permanently Abolished\n\nGovernment has metastasized into the enemy of America's children and families\n\nThomas Jefferson wrote about governments that “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,” In modern English, government exists to do for men those things they cannot do for themselves: protect the nation, ensure tranquility within the nation and guarantee God-given individual rights are not trampled upon within the nation. Our government has failed in that task. Our nation, therefore, is a failed state.\nAnother way of looking at Jefferson’s prescription for government is that it is the government’s job to help protect families and communities, enabling citizens to pursue happiness. Of course, that’s hard to do. Of the 110 billion people who have ever lived, most have lived in civilizations that did not even come close to that goal. Indeed, most lived in civilizations where that goal didn’t even exist, or at least the individual rights element of it.\nFor most of the last 248 years since Jefferson wrote those words about a successful government, and 233 years after Congress ratified the Constitution, binding the nation contractually to those same principles, America largely operated under that contract. Today, however, after less than a quarter century into the new millennia, we must admit that the contract is broken, and America is a failed nation. Our nation no longer serves its people.\nThe first thing that tells us that the nation has failed is children and families. In theory, citizens do not exist for the state; rather, the state exists for the citizens and, especially, for families, which are a nation’s heart and future. It should work in tandem with parents, whose biological imperative is to protect their young.\nToday, however, the government has metastasized so that it is the enemy of families. After destroying the traditional family, states are now dictating to parents that their children can be butchered and there is nothing they can do about it. It’s everywhere: in California, New York, Washington, and even Montana! There is literally nothing in life more natural than a family with children, but states now feel they can literally take children from their parents for the specific purpose of indoctrinating or butchering them. Failed nations do that.\nThen there’s the Climate Change hoax. Al Gore has been telling us since 1999 that CO2 is setting the world on fire and that the oceans will cover half the continent within a decade. Disappointingly, 25 years later, Washington DC is still not under water. Global warming is a fiction, but our government drives at least half a trillion dollars being spent annually to “reduce” our “Carbon footprint.” These expenditures are direct (i.e., hundreds of billions of federal, state, and local government dollars) and indirect (i.e., the financial burdens forced on citizens through higher energy prices, higher transportation costs, and built-in green energy inefficiencies).\nEvery effort is chimerical when you consider human’s actual, minimal CO2 impact. Start with how much CO2 is in the air.\nAs of May 2022. CO2 in the atmosphere was 421 ppm or .04%. But maybe it’s rocketed up since then? Nope. Apparently, 100 ppm of that 421 ppm was generated during the last 120 years. If we were to do nothing, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere in 2120 would sit at 531 ppm or .05%. Not exactly choking the planet.\nSo, our government is essentially crippling our economy, sending inflation through the roof, and introducing a level of energy instability Americans haven’t seen in half a decade to solve a problem that simply doesn’t exist. The governments of serious nations don’t do that.\nFinally, there is the open border and the flood of illegal immigration. Since Joe Biden has been president, almost 10 million people, mostly military-aged males, have poured across our border. American taxpayers must support virtually every one of them.\nTo put that in perspective, if they were a state, the illegal aliens who arrived since Biden’s inauguration would be the 11th largest state, just above New Jersey and just below Michigan. Add to that the 20 million illegals already here, and they would be a larger population than every state other than California and Texas.\nBut it’s not just that the government is allowing millions of people to invade the country. It’s also what governments are doing once the invaders are here. Boston closed a community center to house the illegals. New York City has been paying tens of millions of dollars to hotels to house them and recently forced kids to attend school online because their schools were filled with illegals. What’s more, two weeks ago, New York’s mayor announced the city would give $53 million in prepaid debit cards to illegals. Astonishingly, some places give illegals more than citizens on welfare!\nAll of this costs likely more than $300 billion a year, twice widely circulated estimates of $150 billion that base their number on the laughable assumption that there are only 15 million illegal aliens in America when the number is likely more than 30 million.\nAnd as if spending hundreds of billions annually on illegal aliens wasn’t enough, the illegals are increasing crime in America’s cities even as we deal with skyrocketing domestic crime. From beating up NYPD cops in broad daylight and being released within hours to gangs targeting gated communities outside of Detroit to moped gangs terrorizing New York, illegals have become more and more brazen as they understand the consequences of crime are minimal, particularly when compared to a new spirit of robust government enforcement that is emerging in Central America. And, of course, this doesn’t even begin to measure the consequences of the 100,000 American deaths from the unsecured border’s fentanyl trade.\nAll of this (and much more...) demonstrates that the United States is no longer a serious nation. America not only no longer protects families, but it also actively keeps parents from protecting their children. America no longer seeks to create a framework for prosperity but rather burdens citizens with crippling inflation and stultifying costs to battle a fictional problem. America no longer seeks to defend herself from invasion or her citizens from vicious, violent criminals. When a nation stops protecting its borders, citizens, and prosperity, it ceases to have the right to be called serious.\nEvery single one of these problems and policies has at its core the Democrat party and the swamp bureaucracy that infects every level of government. However, one part of America is still struggling to remain serious, and it’s not represented by the GOP ruling class. It’s the grassroots, it’s the people who were Tea Party patriots, and it’s the citizens who don’t drink the media’s propaganda.\nThe Declaration of Independence states, “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government…” In this case, it’s not a government per se that has become destructive to those ends but the Democrat party. Let’s hope that in November, those who take America seriously take the opportunity to show that vile, despicable party the door…",

And all of us should publicly be asking the question asked by Ricardo Duchesne today: “Why is the Western ruling class in hysterics over tiny Israel without caring one bit for the far worse disaster unfolding for years now — the genetic/cultural destruction of the European race via mass African/Middle Eastern migration?” Nevertheless, it is still important to understand the origins and dynamics of the generations-long Jewish war against Palestinians.\n\nSOME WHITE AMERICANS are getting agitated by the media over alleged Jewish suffering at the hands of Hamas, and the question always arises: Who owns the land that Israel currently occupies?\nI lean more toward the opinion that the Palestinians are in the moral right regarding who really should possess the land that Israel appropriated in 1948. The Jews are forever telling us that the Palestinians did not have a state, since it transitioned rapidly from being a territory of the Ottoman Empire, then a British protectorate, and then. . . Israel. But I don’t see any relevance in that argument. A people need not have organized a state in order to own their land. The reason for organizing a state is to protect your land from being appropriated by force. Unfortunately for them, the Palestinians were never given the time to create guards for their national security. The Jews swooped in too quickly and, with military help from the United States, overwhelmed all Palestinian resistance.\nThe video above details some of the atrocities which the Palestinians have endured for almost 80 years.\nPragmatically, I again favor the Palestinians. Neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians have ever done much for us Americans. But the Palestinians have harmed us less than the Israelis have. The Lavon Affair. The attack on the USS Liberty. The murder of Rachel Corrie. The stealing of US nuclear technology. And many other such things. Israel has been a real pain. And an expensive one.\nIsrael has never been an ally of the United States of America. Not truly. Israel is a parasite. The flow of benefit in the relationship between the two countries has always been one-way only. We give them billions of dollars every year, and we get nothing in return, unless you count the contemptuous attitude that the Jews often show us. Israel has stolen our military secrets and has sold them to Communist countries, and they’ve even attacked our armed forces, and our own government hushes up the thefts. Israel’s partisans in the United States control most of the legacy media, which they used for decades to deceive us about the way power works in the world, to prevent alarm at what they are doing to us from spreading. They control our money, and, to an extent, they still control the flow of information. Israel is not our friend. When our politicians say otherwise, they are lying. They lie because the Jews can tar them with bad publicity and can give their rivals decisive amounts of funding during election campaigns.\nUnderstanding the theft of Palestine from its own people is a little complicated, but the biggest difficulty that most people have is the scale of the theft.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Rothschilds sent their agent, a Jew named Emmanuel Carasso, to Salonica, in Macedonia, with two purposes: (1) overthrow the Turkish sultan and (2) initiate the extermination of the Armenian people. As the first purpose is the one relevant to this answer, I’ll save discussion on the second purpose for another time.\nCarasso created an organization that was initially called “The Committee for Union and Progress,” but which soon acquired the popular name “The Young Turks.” Through various devious methods, they succeeded in changing the Turkish government of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in July 1908. Ten years and a world war later, the British acquired control of Palestine.\nThe British made two contradictory promises: one to the native Palestinians, and the other to the Jews who were immigrating into Palestine and changing the region’s demographics. Which promise would be kept? In the end, the promise made to the Jews was kept. It was called the Balfour Declaration.\n\nThe Rise of Hamas Was Encouraged by Israel\nHamas was started by Israel as a way to subvert the political influence of Yassir Arafat and the PLO. Israel lost control of Hamas, and the Jews’ meddling in this regard has come back to bite them.\n",

        "article": "We're Witnessing The Great Dismantling: As Gigantic Institutions All Lose The Trust Of 'The People' Because Of Their Lawlessness, Americans Are Withdrawing Their 'Consent To Be Governed'\n\nNothing is more fundamental to a civilized society than trust in the law\n\n“It’s not enough to be against globalism or the WEF, we have to also be for something better.” — Tom Luongo, Gold, Goats ‘n Guns\nMr. Luongo makes an important point. I want you to think about this: there is a reason that the WEF-Globalist cabal is losing the battle to control and dominate the rest of us. They are trying to power straight into the opposing currents of reality. Above all, they seek to centralize power and decision-making. But the world is moving in the opposite direction. All of the WEF’s aims founder on the macro trends unspooling in history.\nThe rising rule for human affairs now is that anything organized at the giant scale is going to wobble and fail. There will not be any world government run by the creatures of Davos or Brussels, or Washington DC, or any other place that the grandiose imagine would be their seat of global power. It’s not going happen so you can stop worrying about it. But you’d better prepare for what is happening: everything in our world wants to get smaller, slower, finer, and more local. Anything that opposes these trends is pissing into the wind.\nSince every activity we humans practice has to move in that direction, we are seeing colossal industries, institutions, and arrangements crack up: everything from national government to long-distance supply chains to giant retailing outfits to worldwide business networks to overgrown universities and high schools to transport matrices to metroplex cities to mega-farms to political parties.\nWhere the rot is probably greatest, but more veiled for the moment, is in the operations of organized capital, the banks and money systems, including financial markets. When these monsters blow, as they must, all the others will shake, rattle, and roll. They have to blow because the fuel tank is emptying.\nAmerican oil production may be at an all-time peak now at about 13-million barrels-a-day, but most of that — about 8-million — is shale oil, which is a manifestation of our tremendous debt roll-up since 2009. Now that we’re at the absolute limits of debt, we’re also at the limits of shale oil. The production of shale oil paralleled the accumulation of all that debt both in size and rate of increase, and as the debt goes bad — meaning, unpayable — the organized capital sector will blow and shale oil production will fall as sharply as it rose. It is also a fact that shale oil is subject to natural limits — we’re out of “sweet spots” to drill.\nThat’s America. Europe is way worse because aside from whatever oil is left in the North Sea (not much), Europe has no oil. Europe’s largest gas field — Groningen in the Netherlands — is scheduled to cease operations in October of this year. You all know what happened to the Nord Stream pipelines.\nAnd then Germany, in some psychotic fugue state, shut down its entire nuclear power industry, while France is just not replacing its nuke plants as they age-out. Europe is completely screwed. They won’t have anything we might call modern industry. In the meantime, the WEF is playing them like a flugelhorn, keeping them distracted with “green” politics, an unchecked immigrant invasion, and sexual confusion.\nA lot of the same nuttery afflicts us in the USA, of course, but none of that alters the real macro trends. Our federal government is not really getting more powerful, it’s cracking up, starting from the very top, with a mentally incompetent president — the secret that everybody knows. Agencies like the DOJ and Homeland Security may seem more tyrannical for the moment, but they are actually breaking as institutions because in their lawlessness they’ve lost the trust of the people — and nothing is more fundamental to a civilized society than trust in the law. That’s what consent of the governed means.\nSo, the period of disorderly transition we’re in is not moving toward greater dominance by giants, but to the survival of the small and nimble. We will not see capital formation like the orgy of recent times; rather the vanishing of things falsely presumed to be capital, contraction not expansion. You’ll be struggling to identify and preserve real wealth, which you’ll find in unexpected places, like the friends you can count on, your reputation for honesty, your dependability, acquired skills, and your health, physical and psychological.\nThe WEF won’t be able to impose its Globalist nightmare of elite transhumanism and surveilled bug-eating serfs, and they know it now. They’re running scared. The vile Yuval Noah Harari has even said so publicly. The political figures and agents serving that cabal will be lucky if they are not hanged in the public squares. The political criminals here in America, the hoaxsters, the grifters, the seditionists, the Lawfare agents, the election fraudsters, know very well the looming danger of their prosecutions, and that’s exactly why the Democratic Party and its blob henchmen and flunkies are acting like desperate lunatics.\nExpect: failed national governments, maybe even state governments; failed supply lines; failed electric supply, failed trucking, failed big box stores; failed supermarkets, failed giant companies; failed banks, failed investments, failed money, failed news orgs, failed airlines, failed car dealers, failed hospitals, failed colleges, and much more. But don’t discount human ingenuity and resourcefulness, our ability to work-around and reinvent systems for daily life, even if it’s on a downscaled and more modest level.\nExpect rebuilt local economies from production to wholesale to retail. Expect smaller stores, fewer things to buy but much of it better quality. Expect a lot less long-distance travel but a lot more happening in your locality. Expect the rebirth of local culture — theaters, live music, news-sheets, dances — to replace all the canned entertainments we’re used to. Expect small private academies to rise to replace the shuttered central schools. Expect small, local clinics to appear from the ashes of the medical conglomerates. Expect Americans to return to churches as an organizing mechanism for community relations. Expect more formality and less slobbery in public. Expect all of us to feel a renewed sense of gratitude for being here instead of rage, resentment, and grievance, because it’s likely there will be far fewer of us around.",

        "article": "It's No Longer Any Wonder Why Our Foods Are Being Poisoned, The USDA Is Busy Weaponizing Diseases To KILL Americans! Alarming Proof Our Children Are Targeted For 'Elimination'\n\nThe new story linked to over at SteveQuayle.com earlier this morning published by the Daily Mail titled \"REVEALED: US is collaborating with Chinese scientists to make bird flu strains more infectious and deadly as part of $1m project - despite fears similar tests unleashed Covid\" confirmed much of what we've been reporting on ANP over the last several years; that the US government is weaponizing deadly diseases that are being used against 'the people,' and with virtual impunity.\nAlso confirming that Americans are working with China to create these deadly bioweapons while then lying to our faces about it as Americans and people all across the planet are being killed by them, the research into how the satanic globalists can more easily kill Americans is, of course, being funded by the American taxpayer through the US Department of Agriculture, and as the Daily Mail story reports, this deadly research will not only take place in China but at sites in Georgia and Edinburgh, Scotland.\nProving once again that our 'government overlords' have no problem at all 'creating and then weaponizing' deadly diseases that will be used to kill people, including very real Americans with very real loved ones and families, and that such work is no 'conspiracy theory' at all but part of official US 'health' policy under Joe Biden, as that DM story reports, this particular research involves infecting ducks and geese with different strains to make them more transmissible and infectious, and then studying the viruses' potential to 'jump into mammalian hosts,' according to the research documents.\nAnd while the USDA is busy weaponizing diseases to kill Americans instead of what its' 'X' page claims its duties are, \"Leadership on #food, #agriculture, natural resources, #rural development, #nutrition, & related issues based on public policy, science, & effective management,\" it's no longer any wonder why all across America, our foods are being poisoned as reported in this NY Post story.\nAlarmingly reporting that 80% of Americans have tested positive for a chemical found in Cheerios and Quaker Oats cereals that may cause infertility & delayed puberty, while our baby foods are being poisoned with toxic metals as reported in this Washington Post story, every day brings MORE proof the globalists are targeting our children, the most innocent members of society. for death.\nAs that previously referenced Daily Mail story reports, according to Justin Goodman, the senior vice president of the White Coat Waste Project which uncovered this deadly 'gain of function' research going on that'll be funded by the American people, 'It's reckless and indefensible for... bureaucrats to bankroll dangerous avian flu gain-of-function studies involving virus experimenters from the notorious Wuhan animal lab that likely caused COVID and its CCP-run parent organization, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 'Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill for animal experiments with foreign adversaries that soup up viruses and can cause pandemics or create bioweapons.'\nYet there the USDA goes, using American taxpayer money to pay for this deadly research, another great reason why the USDA, and ALL OF OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES that are involved in such research, should be PERMANENTLY ELIMINATED for their crimes upon humanity.\nYet as we've reported time and again on ANP, according to 'gatekeeper' groups such as Newsguard, any reports of such 'gain of function' research being carried out by US govt agencies are 'crazy conspiracy theories' being pushed by 'right wing media,' the biggest reason ANP is now running only thanks to your donations which we use to simply survive after Newsguard blacklisted us for reporting the truth has seen advertising agencies refuse to run on ANP. Susan and I thank you so much for any donations to ANP that you are able to afford as your donations are truly what are keeping us online.\nAnd isn't it incredibly interesting that those chemicals being found in Cheerios and other Quaker Oats cereals cause INFERTILITY and delayed puberty, the same exact satanic goals that the globalists have long been pushing with their drive to 'depopulate' the planet! The fact that our foods are being poisoned clearly has the globalists names written all over it. Yet, as we've seen over and over again, they'll never be held accountable. And it's too bad the USDA is too busy funding 'gain of function' research on diseases being used to KILL AMERICANS for them to actually DO THEIR JOBS and detect our foods being poisoned every day now. From this alarming Daily Mail story.:\nThe documents were obtained by the campaign group, The White Coat Waste Project, and shared with DailyMail.com.\nThe papers show funding for the avian virus research began in April 2021 and it is slated to continue through March 2026.\nThe specific viruses the researchers will work with include H5NX, H7N9 and H9N2.\nA 2023 study described H5NX viruses as 'highly pathogenic' with the ability to cause neurological complications in humans.\nThe H7N9 strain first infected humans and animals in China in March 2013 and the World Health Organization said it is of concern 'because most patients have become severely ill.'\nThe H9N2 strain has been found in dove in China and while it has a lower pathogenicity than the other strains, it can still infect humans.\nThe main collaborators on the project are USDA Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute - a Wuhan lab partner.\nAdditionally, one of the researchers being funded by the USDA is Wenju Liu, who is affiliated with the WIV - which is believed to have sparked the Covid pandemic - and a member of the board of a scientific journal, working with Zheng-Li Shi, who is known as the 'bat lady' for her extensive work on bat coronaviruses.\nDifferent aspects of the research are slated to take place in multiple locations, including poultry research centers in Athens, Georgia, at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh and at the Chinese academy in Beijing.\nAnd while our foods being poisoned, with children being specifically targeted, might seem bad enough, we get a staggering new report from ICAN, the Informed Consent Action Network, that the globalists are nowhere near finished trying to get their deadly poisons into us all.\nTitled \"ICAN UNCOVERS A POTENTIAL NEXT-LEVEL THREAT: “INHALABLE” SELF-SPREADING VACCINES THAT SPREAD LIKE A VIRUS,\" that story reports.:\nA new class of “encrypted RNA” vaccines are being developed where the RNA would piggyback onto an existing wild virus and spread from person to person without any person’s knowledge or consent. Although this may sound like science fiction, it is far from it. Two companies involved in this research have received millions of dollars from the federal government.\nA study using this technology on hamsters and the SARS-Cov-2 virus has already been completed and a Phase I trial on humans is in the works. ICAN’s attorneys have already sent legal demands to all government agencies involved.\nAdding just more proof that the devils in Washington DC are more than happy to bypass the rule of law, more proof they're doing away with 'informed consent' as we had reported in this January 26th ANP story titled \"FDA Passes New 'Medical Research Laws' Doing Away With 'Informed Consent,' Making Us All Human Guinea Pigs,\" we truly are all 'human guinea pigs' now, and most Americans don't even know it. From this important ICAN story.:\nIt seems the government and the military are so enthused about this new vaccine deployment technology that Congress tucked a law, the PREVENT Pandemics Act, into the 2023 omnibus appropriations bill to facilitate it. Among other things, the Act has a section dedicated to Platform Technologies that supports the “development and review of new treatments and countermeasures that use cutting-edge, adaptable platform technologies that can be incorporated or used in more than one drug or biological product.”\nThis Act will also be used to fund a new HHS government agency called ARPA-H (Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health), which was created in 2023 to “take big technical risks that can spark new biomedical breakthroughs” and “revolutionize the detections, diagnosis, mitigation, prevention, treatment and cure of diseases and health conditions.” Both former NIH Director Francis Collins and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra supported the agency’s creation, and Collins described his vision for ARPA-H as “a DARPA-like culture at NIH.”\nThis so-called “therapy” uses a technology called TIPs (Therapeutic Interfering Particles), which are described as “engineered molecular parasites” that piggyback on a wild virus. If you get the virus, you also get these parasites. Once inside an infected person, the TIPs are supposed to rapidly multiply, hijacking the resources the wild virus needs to multiply and therefore stopping the virus.\nSupporters of this technology claim it will “solve” several problems with traditional vaccine delivery, including “behavior barriers” like noncompliance. Meaning everyone gets vaccinated—whether they like it or not.\nJust another reason why these US government terrorist agencies need to be completely 'eliminated' for the sake of humanity, as they've clearly showed they don't have the best interests of the human race in mind and are more than happy to murder Americans and people all across the planet when that 'murdering' fits their 'needs,' it's no wonder that Tucker Carlson recently told the World Government Summit that the US government is now using its' power as a force of evil, because all of the information discussed within this story provides more proof that these people and organizations, who Americans support by paying tax money to, is proving itself to be the biggest force of evil on our entire planet in 2024.\n",

Why Are Doctors \"Baffled?\" in which we learn that strange cancers, along with vaccine deaths, are skyrocketing across the planet. Yet the United Nations will NEVER take responsibility for the role they played in that very real genocide being carried out before our eyes.\nJosh Sigurdson reports on the historic rise in cancer as the United Nations, WHO and media warn of a 77% increase in the rate of cancer in the coming 25 years. The problem is that it's already much worse than that and of course for reasons other than those claimed by the establishment propagandists.\nDoctors are claiming they're \"baffled\" by the increased rate in cancer over the past 3 years despite it being blatantly obvious. They're claiming alcohol, tobacco and aging are causing the increased rate of cancer when the elephant is clearly standing in the room with us. It's the injections.\nIn fact, we can trace the rate of cancer with the rate of injections side by side and it almost looks like the same chart. Thai corporate media has reported that covid injections definitely lead to an increased rate in cancers, including so-called \"Turbo Cancer.\" Switzerland health insurance data shows a 73% increase in cancer treatments since 2020. The UK government has released data showing young people dying of cancer at an explosive rate in the past 3 years. US government data has also shown a staggering 143,233% increase in fatal cancer cases linked to covid vaccinations.\nNow one must understand that that number is based on cases LINKED to covid vaccination, so the number appears high, though keep in mind that likely around 90% of cases are NOT linked to covid injections when they should be. Meanwhile, Moderna has admitted that their injections cause cancer due to the same DNA editing technology that Pfizer uses. This is a global health crisis and there ARE solutions outside of big pharma. From apricot seeds to oils and chlorine dioxide. It's time people take charge of this crisis.\nAnd as we're warned in the 3rd video below, with the United Nations and the globalists now strongly pushing for worldwide censorship, if the UN gets their way, it'll one day be illegal for 'free people' to even talk about this 'genocide' and the 'globalists war upon the world,' meaning they truly will be able to get away with their 'crimes upon humanity' with utter impunity, unless the 'people' of the planet put a final stop to it.\nAccording to the UK government in this January 31st announcement from their website, those who post 'fake news' online could be jailed for up to 5 years. With 'fake news' being what 'government' determines it to be, and the globalists calling just about anything that goes against their agenda either 'fake news,' misinformation or disinformation, any tyranny would love to have that power the UK govt seeks, using it to shut down dissent and any and all investigations into them carrying out genocide or 'crimes upon humanity'.\nCalling such reports 'disinformation' and jailing those investigating them for up to 5 years, as this 'X' post by 'TheStarkNakedBrief'points out, 'news' put out by MSM outlets aren't held to the same standards. Meaning they can continue to lie to the world with impunity, it won't be long until we here in America are held to the same tyrannical 'standards' if the 'global government terrorists' get their way.:\nHere's the interesting part about Rishi's tyrannical new online bill...\nYesterday, his government announced that offences under new online laws have kicked in so \"criminals can face up to five years behind bars for their demeaning and dangerous actions.”\nPart of this new law outlines a new “fake news” offence - a false communications offence - that outlaws the intentional sending of false information that could cause “non-trivial psychological” or physical harm to users online.\nThe govt provided an example. Basically, if someone encouraged people to inject antiseptic to cure themselves of coronavirus on social media, a court would have to prove that they knew if was not true before making the post.\nBut guess what? Recognized news publishers and broadcasters (including on demand services), like the BBC etc. are exempt from this provision.\nWith global-government-tied entities now building a network using artificial intelligence that will flag 'misinformation' sent even in private messages as reported in this recent Reclaim The Net story, while 'global government' claims anything and everything that goes against their agenda falls into the 'fake news/misinformation' category, we've long warned that governments 'policing our speech' is how dictatorships are cemented into place.\nAnd should they acquire the power to jail people for up to 5 years or longer for reporting 'truth,' the kinds of 'truths' that global government seeks to permanently turn into 'lies,' we'll have officially crossed that line into tyranny that there's no turning back from short of all out revolution or Civil War.\nSo with the Secretary General of the United Nations warning of dire chaos ahead as we race towards 2025, blaming ongoing wars all across the planet largely in his summary, yet he and the United Nations and every government across the planet refusing to accept responsibility for their own roles in this mad dash into tyranny and total destruction and chaos, in the 4th and final video below Joe Rogan warns us bluntly that he believes something huge lays just around the corner, and that it worries him, as we follow 'political leaders' who've proven they are psychopaths into a world unlike anything most of us have ever seen in our lifetimes, a world of madness, chaos and social unrest that most of us have long been preparing for.",

        "article": "Brutal Special Council Report Reveals Joe Biden Was Mentally Diminished In 2017 - This Was Labeled As Disinformation By The MSM As Independent Media Reported On Biden's Memory At The Time\n\nPresidents by and large do not run every aspect of the White House, as they are briefed on issues or events and then make the final call or decision on subsequent actions, but in the case of Joe Biden, it has been made clear by the brutal special counsel report on his handling of classified documents that he is unfit to hold office.\nSince before the 2020 election, many in the Independent Media highlighted the diminished mental capacity of Biden, while the MSM insisted we were wrong, and in the three years since, we have seen Biden fall on multiple occasions, claimed to have spoken to people that have been dead for years, slur his words on a regular basis, and make claims that are factually false.\nSuch as Joe Biden's claim that he has made multiple times about his son, Beau Biden dying in Iraq, when in reality, Beau Biden died of a brain tumor at Walter Reed National Medical Center in Maryland in 2015.\nIn his Special Council report, Robert Hur documented that Biden had forgot when he was VP and when his son Beau died.\n...He did not remember when he was vice president, forgetting on the first day of the interview when his term ended (\"if it was 2013 - when did I stop being Vice President?\"), and forgetting on the second day of the interview when his term began (\"in 2009, am I still Vice President?\"). 839 He did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died....\nMany have highlighted the Special Counsel's consistent references to Biden's memory problems, made worse by the fact that the Biden's lawyers attempted to get SC Hur to remove or change portions of the report that referenced his memory in a letter\nNot only do you treat the President differently from other witnesses when discussing his limited recall of years-ago events, but you do so on occasions in prejudicial and inflammatory terms. You refer to President Biden's memory on at least nine occasions - a number that is in itself gratuitous. But, even among those nine instances, your report varies. It is one thing to observe President Biden's memory as being \"significantly limited\" on certain subjects. Id. at 5. It is quite another to use the more sweeping and highly prejudicial language employed later in the report. This language is not supported by the facts, nor is it appropriately used by a federal prosecutor in this context.\nWe request you revisit your descriptions of President Biden's memory and revise then so that they are stated in a manner within the bounds of your expertise and remit.\nThe entire report is embedded at the bottom of this article, but what I would like to highlight, which we have not seen many do as of yet, is the fact that the the Special Counsel also highlights via the evidence seen during the course of the investigation, that Biden's memory issue were also clear in 2017, before he was installed into the office of President.\nThe Special Counsel, on page 211, discusses Promise Me, Dad, the book Biden wrote with Mark Zwonitzer (ghost writer) in early 2017. Hur references recordings from the time which were handed over to the office of Special Counsel, which led them to state \"Mr. Biden's memory also appeared to have significant limitations-both at the time he spoke to Zwonitzer in 2017, as evidenced by their recorded conversations, and today, as evidenced by his recorded interview with our office. Mr. Biden's recorded conversations with Zwonitzer from 2017 are often painfully slow, with Mr. Biden struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries.\"\nThis vindicates Independent Media that highlighted Biden's mentally diminished capacity, was correct at the time, while the media was calling it disinformation.\nAs a side note, Mark Zwonitzer deliberately deleted evidence, and is also not being charged for doing so.\nVia Fox News: President Biden's ghostwriter will not face charges despite deleting evidence of the sharing of classified material during the investigation. Mark Zwonitzer — who collaborated with Biden on his memoir \"Promise Me, Dad\" — erased audio files in his possession that contained \"significant evidentiary value,\" according to a report published by Special Counsel Robert Hur. Zwonitzer admitted to the FBI that he \"was aware that there was an investigation\" when he deleted the evidence.\nHur also seems to attempt to justify not recommending charges against Biden because he \"would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\nThe report set off a firestorm of reactions, including Representative Claudia Tenney writing to AG Merrick Garland to start proceedings to have Biden removed under the 25th Amendment. Her last sentence states President Biden needs to be charged, or he needs to be removed. There is no middle ground.\"\nIt is unlikely that Kamala Harris or Biden's cabinet will remove him, although the pressure, even by the liberal media, will probably have them at least discussing the issue.\nBiden, or to be more accurate, whoever is making decisions for him, set up a press conference in an attempt to do damage control after the release of the devastating report, and that was perhaps not such a good idea.\nInitially he made a statement, which attempted to counter the Special Counsel's report, specifically about his memory issues, and then allowed a few questions, which was perhaps the biggest mistake as the media, for once, did their job.\nListen below, and note, that Biden misidentified Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as the \"president of Mexico.\"\nBiden stops rambling and questions begin at the 4:00 minute mark in the video below.\n\nBOTTOM LINE....\nWhile I take no pleasure in anyone declining mentally, I also think a senile man should not be the figurehead President for the United States of America.\nIt screams weakness, and while we see Russian mouthpiece, Dmitrij Medvedev, declaring that if NATO countries go to war with Russia, \"It would resemble the infamous Apocalypse, the end of everything,\" it reminds us the need for strength in a President, which Biden doesn't have.",

Pharma'\n\nColleges And Universities Issuing New Mandates For All Students To Be Vaxxed\n\nWhile a big part of America is 'awakening' quickly to the genocide unleashed upon the country and the world by the COVID-19 bioweapon 'death shots' some are still calling 'vaccines,' as this new story over at Zero Hedge reports, America's so-called 'best and brightest' are refusing to acknowledge 'reality,' with ZH reporting Harvard University is among at least 69 colleges and universities across America renewing their COVID-19 vaccine mandates for their upcoming semesters.\nWith Harvard U putting out a statement that read \"Harvard requires all students who will be on campus to have some protection from COVID-19 through vaccination through the initial primary series of COVID-19 vaccination or one of the most recent COVID-19 boosters,” that once-esteemed university, which thrived upon their research, has joined the ranks of the 'woke' and 'fallen,' while quite literally putting the lives of their students at risk, to appease the genocidal psychopaths in Washington DC, the World Health Organization and 'big pharma'.\nBecause with the COVID-19 'vaccines' offering no 'protection' what-so-ever to those who've gotten the shots as seen in the countless numbers of 'injected' who still caught COVID soon after their injections, we can see in this latest madness coming from America's 'top universities' that they are more than happy to 'bend over' for 'global government' and push 'the line' of the World Health Organization and endorse their 'pandemic treaty' in which they seek to gain complete control over everything.\nWith the WHO hoping their 'pandemic treaty' is finalized by May of 2024 according to this report by the World Economic Forum, a treaty that they hope will give them 'total control' over how member countries deal with the 'next pandemic,' including what rules and lockdowns and 'vaccines' people of those member countries are required to follow and inject into their bodies, as we'd warned on ANP back on January 24th, this is how the World Health Organization's pandemic treaty is being used by the globalists to establish a planetary dictatorship that will be used to control every facet of our lives.\nAnd as we see by what's now happening at Harvard University and at least 69 other universities, despite the proven risks of that COVID injection and the countless deaths we've been witnessing since this 'vax rollout' began, including the staggering numbers of 'turbo cancers' we're still witnessing developing exploding worldwide, America's 'top universities' are putting a global government medical dictatorship ahead of the health and well-being of their own students, another sign of where we're all being herded in the days ahead.\nAnd with the WEF, WHO, CDC and all of the globalist buffoons now heavily pushing the arrival of 'Disease X' to frighten 'the masses' into pushing their own governments to take part in this 'pandemic treaty,' and most of those 'frightened masses' being totally unaware of what the treaty will be used for, this new drive to get government's around the world to take part in that 'pandemic treaty' also comes at a time when less and less Americans and people around the world are getting 'vaxxed'.\nAs reported in this January 16th story over at Science Alert titled \"Vaccination Rates in The US Could Be Close to a Dangerous Tipping Point,\" that story had reported \"Experts from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US are warning that the country is close to a vaccination tipping point: a point where there aren't enough vaccinated people to protect the unvaccinated, leading to deaths that would otherwise have been prevented.\"\nYet as we've seen over and over and over again over the last few years, the 'injection' they're pushing as a 'vaccine,' but that Dr. Paul Alexander has warned is really a 'slow kill bioweapon,' hasn't offered ANY 'protection' to 'the vaccinated' but is slowly but surely killing off the recipients as far too many are developing 'turbo cancers' and falling ill with 'the disease' the 'vax' was allegedly created to protect them from.\nAnd as Ethan Huff warns us all in this new story at Natural News, now Bill Gates and the globalists are pushing 'patches' instead of 'injections' as 'the answer,' hoping that the people who'll no longer allow medical authorities to 'stick them' in their arms will instead willingly line up to have a 'patch' applied to their skin.\nStraight from the mouth of Bill Gates from this January story over at Newsweek titled \"Bill Gates Reveals Plan to Change Vaccines\" despite the well known fact that Bill Gates is NOT a doctor.:\nBillionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently spoke about new plans to change the way vaccines are administered, created and distributed around the globe.\nWhile appearing on CNBC TV18 in India, Gates was asked how he sees vaccine manufacturing around the globe amid different tech and health care advancements.\n\"We make sure, for all these vaccines, that there's enough capacity, that there's competition so the prices keep going down,\" Gates said. \"And we will have new vaccines. We'll have a TB [tuberculosis] vaccine, malaria vaccine, HIV vaccine.\"\nAs Gates continued, he spoke about the COVID-19 vaccine and explained ways it could change.\n\"We need to make them have longer duration, more coverage,\" he said. \"And we're gonna change, instead of using a needle, to use a little patch.\"\nAnd of course, Gates wasted no time at all in blaming the 'conspiracy theorists' for the fact that so many people are rejecting their vaxxes, despite the fact that 'the vaxxes' definitely ARE NOT preventing people from getting 'COVID,' or from 'transmitting COVID' to others, nor from dying.\nWith that Newsweek story reporting Gates had made his comments soon after speaking at the WEF meeting in Davos, and Gates announcing he'd be spending more than $8 billion more dollars to develop new 'health care technology,' that story also reported that back in November, Reuters had reported a company called Micron Biomedical had gotten a $23.6 million donation from Gates to develop those 'vaccine patches,' which is nothing less than the globalists attempting to trick 'the masses' into getting injections without the needles. And as Newsweek had reported, Gates wasn't too happy with all of the 'conspiracy theories.' From that story.:\nFollowing the rollout of the different COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., many conspiracy theories surrounded Gates, with anti-vaxxers claiming that he had microchips placed in the vaccines.\n\"There's a constant dialogue of anybody who gets, you know, this crazy stuff published, going to the digital platforms and saying: 'Hey, look at this, look at that.'\" Gates told ABC News Australia in January 2023 regarding the conspiracy theories. \"Maybe I should complain even more, but I certainly point out false stories when they're published, or even people who highlight sort of almost silly misinformation.\"\nHowever, following his recent remarks about changing the way some vaccines are administered and manufacturing new shots, some social media users criticized Gates.\n\"GREAT! Vaccines for everything,\" actor Russel Brand wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Bill Gates and the WEF's global takeover is HERE.\"\nX user Concerned Citizen wrote: \"Eugenicist Bill Gates wants as many of his vaccines in as many people as possible. Good news though - it will no longer necessarily be an injection - you can now take his Gene Therapy through simple applied patches - I'm sure the children will be extremely happy about not needing to be stabbed in order to develop autism & whatever side effects may come on the label.\"\nShowing that Gates is quite literally thinking that Americans and people around the world are too stupid to see what is really going on, and believing people will be lining up like pigs at a slaughterhouse to get this 'newest technology' that will allow those who are dedicated to 'depopulation' to transmit a bioweapon into our bodies without the 'dreaded jab,' it's clearly long past time the 'eugenicists' who are pushing these poisons upon the planet to accomplish their goal of 'mass murder' are given a one-way ticket to the slaughterhouse for their never-ending crimes upon humanity.",

        "article": "Freedom of Speech at stake: Israeli policy debates in the US\r\n\r\nAcademic freedom appears to be in peril as campus criticism of Israel sparks backlash\r\n\r\nIf you think the United States, a country whose national anthem proudly identifies it as “the land of the free and home of the brave” and whose citizens’ First Amendment right to free speech and assembly is considered no less than sacrosanct, is a place where people are not blacklisted — by definition having their names besmirched and their careers ruined — because the mainstream opposes their views, well, think again.\r\nThink instead of how supporters of Israel here, a group that wields power disproportionate to their numbers, have for decades dominated the public discourse over the Palestine-Israel conflict and how now own the narrative over the Gaza war, imbuing it with a pugnacious you’re-with-us or you-go-to-hell posture aimed at not only stifling debate but shaming and even penalising those with views different from theirs.\r\nMuzzling free speech is un-American, isn’t it? No it ain’t. Not as we speak. Not in the fog of war.\r\nThe condemnation by Kathy Hochel, New York governor, of a rally in support of Palestinians in New York City’s Times Square soon after the outbreak of war as “abhorrent and morally repugnant” was just the opening salvo.\r\n\r\nTensions flared at elite institutions\r\nSoon after that still, when the Harvard [University] Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee issued a statement, cosigned by 33 other Harvard student organisations, in which they took the Palestinian side, claiming that “the war did not occur in a vacuum” because “for the last two decades millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison [while] Israel promises to ‘open the gates of hell’ ... “ the group drew not only intense campus criticism but also intense national backlash — so intense that some of the co-signers found themselves under so much pressure that they retracted their endorsements.\r\nIt didn’t stop there. Calls were made on the university to remove all the organisations’ school affiliations, while former University president Lawrence H. Summers called the joint statement “morally unconscionable”. Then all this was followed by several lawmakers in Congress, from both sides of the aisle, denouncing it as “anti-Semitic”, and worse.\r\nA hefty donor to the university, William Ackman, a Harvard alumnus and hedge-fund billionaire, went further still — he demanded that the university release a list of the names of all students who were members of the cosigning groups, promising to call on Wall Street execs to refuse to hire them upon their graduation.\r\nAmerican campuses have become redoubts of sympathy for the Palestinian cause in America — which has worried these supporters, in particular those able to wield their influence as they demand that academic institutions do something about it.\r\n\r\nComing together in grief\r\nAnd the University of Pennsylvania is one of these institutions, which now finds itself enmeshed in what the media has called a “controversy” over a recent Palestinian festival held there, one that showcased Palestinian art and culture and drew roughly 1,500 attendees from around the world. Though the event had been held several weeks before the war, it still pushed wealthy donors to now come out of the woodwork and bring the tensions surrounding criticism of Israel on campus to a high pitch.\r\nThese folks are now up in arms, angry that the university had allowed such a conference to take place, demanding that the school’s president, Liz Magill, resign. The effort is led by one Marc Rowan, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management, who donated more $50 million to the school and recently called on other donors to call off funds. Many have joined his call. Among them was Dick Wolf, producer of the television franchise “Law and Order”, who endowed the Wolf Humanities Center and was especially miffed that — Oh, the horror, the horror! — the Palestinian festival was actually held there.\r\nIn a telephone interview with the New York Times, Mr. Rowan blurted: “President Magill’s allowing UPenn’s impramature to be associated with this conference normalised and legitimised violence that ranged from the targeting of Jewish students to horrific attacks on Israel”.\r\nIt’s not altogether clear how a festival that celebrated Palestinian art and culture could be seen as a deadly threat to Jewish students and the Israeli state, but there you have it.\r\nAnd finally, on Friday, 92NY, one of New York City’s premier cultural centers on the Upper East Side, with a seating capacity of 900, abruptly cancelled a lecture by the renowned, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, Viet Thanh Nguyen — whose book, A Man With Two Faces, engages the question of exile, alienation, memory, identity and inherited trauma, conditions that lie at the core of every uprooted people’s sensibility — after it was discovered that he had been one of the 750 signatories to an Open Letter, that had appeared in the London Review of Books, critical of Israel’s merciless bombardment of the densely populated Gaza Strip.\r\nThe event was later moved to a bookstore in Lower Manhattan, where it drew a standing room crowd of 100.\r\nIn a statement the following day, 92NY said in part: “We are a Jewish institution that has always welcomed people with diverse points of view, [but] given the public comments by the invited author on Israel, we feel a responsible course of action was to postpone the event”. (Last time we checked, “postpone” was not a synonym for “cancel”.)\r\nIn the US, and to a lesser extent in Europe, the public discourse is a free-for-all — except, sadly, when it comes to Palestinians and those who support their cause. These folks simply have to be careful what they say and, yes, even what they do.\r\nHey, we all remember the time in July, 2000, when the Freud Society of Vienna cancelled a lecture by Edward Said, the celebrated Palestinian-American academic and public intellectual, after members of the society saw a photo of him, at the Lebanese border, poised to hurl what he later called a “symbolic” stone at an Israeli guardhouse. Johan August Sculein, the society’s president, later told the New York Times in a telephone interview, “A lot of members of our society told us that they cannot accept an engaged Palestinian who also throws stones at Israeli soldiers”.\r\nOh, yes, it’s true. The more things change ... well, you know the rest of it.",

Mike Johnson shows the ascendance of this movement and where the power in the Republican Party truly lies, then you're not paying attention,\" Gaetz told the conservative War Room internet show.\r\nBut in a sign of the choppy waters ahead, Gaetz told reporters separately that the new speaker would be prohibited from repeating what the hard right considered one of McCarthy's sins - throwing multiple issues into giant \"omnibus\" bills that force all-or-nothing votes, allowing the leadership to block dissent on contentious issues.\r\n\r\nMistaken identity\r\nCritics say his predecessor McCarthy was ousted mainly because he relied on governing by \"continuing resolution\" - the stop-gap bills that essentially kick the can down the road by keeping the country ticking over at current spending levels.\r\nHe will likely be given leeway to get through the fast-approaching November shutdown deadline with another legislative band aid, perhaps until mid-January.\r\nBut conservatives yearning for smaller government will soon expect him to get back to budgeting through the committee process, where every lawmaker gets to debate spending levels and make their case for cuts.\r\nAnd then there's the delicate issue of fundraising. Johnson has some catching up to do to transform from a middling money-spinner to the head of the kind of cash-cow operation that made McCarthy friends all over Washington.\r\nAnalysts are split on how much Johnson is likely to reach across the aisle.\r\nDemocrats revile the evangelical Christian and his fellow 146 Republicans who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\r\nIn the meantime, the name of the game will be breaking bread with friends and adversaries alike, and introducing himself to an American public that has almost no idea who he is.\r\nCloser to home, he's not off to the best start.\r\nArizona's Paul Gosar, a lawmaker from Johnson's own side of the aisle, circulated a press release rallying support for the new speaker - but fluffed his new boss's name.\r\n\"It is time for House Republicans and Congress to unite around Jim Johnson and get to work to solve the many problems ailing our nation,\" the errant congressman said.",

        "article": "The Consequences of Zionist Mentality and Psychology… Racism (1)\r\n\r\nThe problem with Israel is that it is a product of Zionism, affected by fundamental ailments or defects inherent to it. These symptoms are an integral part of its existence serving as a barrier and obstacle between us and them.\r\nRecognizing our occupier and enemy, who threatens our land and existence, is a religious and national duty. Thus, it is crucial that we understand these dangerous consequences arising from the Zionist mentality and psychology. These consequences are rooted in the dangerous teachings of the Talmud and fueled by the most precarious aspirations of Zionism.\r\nThe first defect is racism, which is an inherent problem in the structure of Jewish religious thought, created by the books of the Torah and its supplements. It’s nurtured and developed by the teachings of the Talmud, which Jews sanctify more than the Torah. Jews believe that they are the people to whom Judaism belongs, and Torah is these people’s book, even Allah the Almighty, is these people’s Lord, referring to the people of \"Israel.\"\r\nWe find that the Quran clearly and definitely declares: \" Allah is the Lord of mankind,\" \"the Lord of all things,\" and \"the Lord of the worlds.\" It does not say, \" He is the Lord of the Arabs\" or \"the Lord of the Muslims.\" In contrast, the Torah affirms concerning God: \"He is the Lord of Israel\"!\r\nIndeed, the Torah, from beginning to end, focuses solely on the people of Israel, their history, and their aspirations. It doesn’t mention at all the hereafter, paradise, or hell, just emphasizing the dominion and the glory of \"Israel.\"\r\nThe Torah describes the people of Israel as the \"chosen people.\" We used to say this about them when they carried the message of monotheism, fought against polytheism, and followed the teachings of the prophets. However, this changed when they deviated in their beliefs and behaviors, opposing the prophets and messengers.\r\nThe Quran criticized their actions saying: “But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.” (Al-Baqara: 87) This why, John the Baptist and Jesus, peace be upon them, told them: \"O offspring of those who killed the prophets!\"\r\nAnd that is why the Quran, which declared that Allah favored the Children of Israel over the worlds of their time, also said: \"Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary. {78} That was because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed. They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did. How wretched was that which they were doing!\" (Al-Ma'idah: 79) and \" They will be humiliated wherever they are encountered, except through a rope from Allah, and a rope from people; and they have incurred wrath from Allah, and they were stricken with misery. That is because they rejected Allah’s revelations and killed the prophets unjustly. That is because they rebelled and committed aggression.\" (Aal-E-Imran: 112).\r\nSome people have been led to believe that naming \"Israel\" the \"chosen people\" is similar to naming the Islamic nation \"the best nation brought out for the people,\" which is a clear misconception. The Islamic nation is not a racist nation; it’s a nation of a message, goals, and principles for anyone who believes in and adheres to them. Thus, anyone who believes in these messages, regardless of their ethnicity, color, or homeland, is part of this nation.\r\nThe Jews have portrayed themselves to the world as a persecuted and homeless race, wielding the accusation of anti-Semitism, and exploiting it in a vicious manner.\r\nThe truth is that most Jews today are neither Semitic nor descendants of Israel, which have been confirmed by many fair Western researchers. A significant portion of Jews can be traced back to the Khazar Kingdom, which originated in Eastern Europe when some Tatar tribes converted to Judaism. After its fall, some of them spread to the Crimea region, and Poland became their main settlement. Around the year 1650, it was estimated that their population in Poland was around half a million, where they enjoyed a great deal of self-government. This was until 1658 when the Ukrainian Khmelnytsky armies massacred them and destroyed their community.\r\nThe Jews have always complained to the world and its influential powers about anti-Semitism, yet now they oppose the \"true Semitism\" represented by the Arab Palestinian people, who were expelled from their homes and displaced unjustly.\r\nThe Jews, who once complained about the racist Nazism, embody today a new, fanatical form of Nazism, one that only sees itself and does not acknowledge the rights of others, especially when they oppose its principles.",

        "article": "Untreated diseases could kill more than bombings in Gaza, WHO warns\n\nUntreated diseases could eventually kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the health system is not restored, the World Health Organization says.\n\nDiarrhoea and respiratory infections are widespread among children in overcrowded UN facilities where almost 1.1 million people are sheltering.\nPatients with chronic illnesses like cancer are also receiving no treatment.\nThe warning comes as a truce between Israel and Hamas entered a fifth day, after a 48-hour extension was agreed.\nThe deal mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States should see an additional 20 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza being released in exchange for 60 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli prisons.\nOn Monday, 11 hostages and 33 prisoners were freed on the fourth and final day of the initial agreement, bringing the totals to 50 hostages and 150 prisoners released.\nNineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.\nGaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.\nThe UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.\nWHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told a news conference in Geneva that an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels by early November.\nNo treatment is available for them, she said, without which infants in particular can deteriorate and die very quickly.\nAccording to the UN, only five hospitals are partially operational in the north of Gaza, the area that has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive.\nEight of the 11 hospitals are functional in the south, where the Israeli military has ordered civilians to flee. Only one of those hospitals has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery.\n\"Eventually, we will see more people dying from disease than we are even seeing from the bombardment if we are not able to put back [together] this health system,\" Dr Harris warned.\nAddressing journalists via video link from Gaza, Unicef spokesman James Elder reported seeing hospitals full of children with horrendous war wounds.\nHe described seeing one child missing part of his leg lying untreated on a hospital floor for several hours because of a lack of medical staff. Other injured children were lying in car parks and gardens outside, he said.\nDisplaced children and their families are also suffering because of a lack of proper shelter and clothing to protect them from the rainy and cold weather currently in Gaza.\nOver the first four days of the truce, 800 aid lorries entered Gaza, with some reaching the north, according to US officials. That is an increase in comparison to the preceding few days, but it is still just a fraction of the usual number.\nThe UN agencies say that in such conditions, a resumption in fighting should be unthinkable, they are calling again for a permanent ceasefire.\nIsrael's prime minister has promised that its military will \"go to realising our goals with full force\" when the pause ends.\nHowever, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it would use the extension to seek a \"sustainable truce that would lead to further negotiations and eventually an end... to this war\".\n\"We are working with what we have. And what we have right now is the provision to the agreement that allows us to extend days as long as Hamas is able to guarantee the release of at least 10 hostages,\" spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha.\nHe added that mediators hoped to receive information from Hamas about the more than 150 Israelis and foreign nationals still being held hostage, who include children as young as 10 months old as well as a number of soldiers.\nA senior Hamas source in Qatar told the BBC that not all of the civilian hostages were in its hands. Some were with smaller armed groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers.\nAccording to the source, Hamas needs more time to collect information and contact people. Communication is very difficult because of the damage to the telecoms network and the shortage of fuel to power it.\nMr Ansari also said only \"minimal breaches\" of the truce had been reported.\nBut two hours after he spoke the Israeli military said three explosive devices had been detonated near its troops in two different locations in northern Gaza in violation of the agreement.\n\"In one of the locations, terrorists also opened fire at the troops, who responded with fire. A number of soldiers were lightly injured during the incidents,\" it added.\nHamas's military wing said there had been \"friction\" in the north and that its fighters had dealt with an \"clear breach\" of the truce deal by Israeli troops.\nGunfire and explosions were earlier reported in north-western Gaza City.\nA local journalist told the BBC that dozens of displaced people were trying to return to their houses in the Sheikh Radwan area when they approached Israeli army positions, and that an Israeli tank and troops fired warning shots. One person was wounded and a building was hit by a shell, they said.",

        "article": "Deafening silence on Gaza’s crippling health infrastructure\r\n\r\nRaids, shootings, and mass destruction are the norm with Israeli impunity being sanctioned directly by Washington D.C.\r\n\r\nAs miniscule aid teeters its way through the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt and women, children, and the disabled hang on to shackles of fleeting hope, the dire meltdown of Gaza’s healthcare system remains a classic case of international apathy. So far, the Western-led response to the unfolding genocide has been shockingly indifferent. The source of respite for the battered and besieged population is its hospitals, yet the Zionist entity has stripped Gaza of any relief whatsoever. As stated by the United Nations and the Gazan Health Ministry, the generators of hospitals across the strip will cease to function due to a fuel shortage. Despite this, the deafening silence toward Gaza’s health predicament remains.\r\nAs Israeli airstrikes intensify, approximately thirty-two health centers remain out of service. The occupation forces have made it clear that no fuel would be provided to Gaza as the territory is scorched by an apartheid government targeting refugee camps ranging from Jabaliya to Al-Shati'. Raids, shootings, and mass destruction are the norm with Israeli impunity being sanctioned directly by Washington D.C. The casualty toll stands at above 7,000 and rising with hospitals being flooded with patients by the minute. Those internally displaced number 1.4 million while 600,000 are taking refuge in the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine facilities in dire conditions. The average number of IDPs per shelter has also reached 2.5 times of existing capacity.\r\nAccording to the Gazan Health Ministry Spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qudra, the flow of humanitarian aid will have little impact on the unfolding dynamics in the healthcare sector. The entire structure was already grappling with systematic degradation of its facilities due to a decades-long occupation, and, as per al-Qudra, it has now reached its worst stage in history. Lack of blood units, threats to incubators, which are critical for premature babies to recover, and shortage of manpower are translating into a nightmarish scenario for Gazans. The UNRWA has warned that it could be forced to stop operations due to dwindling fuel supplies as calls mount for a humanitarian pause. With one-third of Palestinian casualties since October 7, 2023, being children alone, apathy toward the healthcare system is resulting in a complete loss of generations.\r\nThe Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza’s Beit Lahia area, for example, was shut down as it failed to carry out its services due to a lack of power. Footage shared on social media showed the hospital operating in complete darkness amid apprehensions of Israeli airstrikes in close proximity to the staff, patients, and doctors. In harrowing scenes, medical personnel were seen using portable flashlights to carry patients from ambulances, of which many were in critical condition. While power was eventually restored at the Indonesian Hospital, the unfolding scenes were an ominous sign of things awaiting other medical facilities across the Strip.\r\nYet, despite making cosmetic appeals to a fascist Prime Minister to allow unfettered aid into Gaza, US President Joe Biden did not mention, caution, or pressure \"Israel\" on the declining state of hospitals in Gaza. In essence, by not doing so, the United States and its Western allies have signed the death warrant for Gazans as any castigation of \"Israel’s\" inhumane occupation, bombardment, and crimes against humanity is deflected with the \"right to self-defense\" argument with disproportionate attention paid to Hamas as the so-called \"greatest threat\" to regional peace and stability. In fact, Hamas lived up to its expectations by releasing Israeli hostages, yet there is no relenting on the part of the occupation and its forces as far as cutting off critical supplies, such as fuel for hospitals, is concerned.\r\nAmong the worst affected by the medical meltdown are premature children or neonatal patients who suffer the most from the chilling, immoral, disgusting, and deplorable policy of the occupation. The constant flow of electricity for glass incubators is critical for such patients, many of whom develop health complications due to early births. That flow is solely dependent on fuel for generators that power hospitals, which remains scarce. According to the director of al-Aqsa Hospital, Iyad Abu Zahar, if the generators do stop working, the babies in the incubators could perish.\r\nWhat is unfolding in al-Aqsa Hospital is ubiquitous across the Gaza Strip. Al-Quds Hospital received warnings from the Israeli military to evacuate in the absence of fuel, which is a clear indication that doctors treating premature babies could fail to save lives. Injured people have been seen lying on floors, Palestinians cramped up in tents, and even kidney patients were apprehensive over whether they would be able to receive dialysis treatment. Even prior to the war, the Health Ministry in Gaza warned of patients suffering from a complete medical breakdown given the sixteen-year blockade by both Egypt and \"Israel\". The abject nature of Gaza’s predicament, however, elicits no response.\r\nThe question is, has the Western-led so-called \"international response\" signed the death warrant for ordinary Gazans? If not, then why is the crippling health sector not being addressed to at least save the lives of those who have nothing to do with war but continue to remain a victim under an occupation. Most states would use the Israeli \"self-defense\" card to either ignore or bypass realities. That, however, does not change reality itself as Gazan’s health structure is on the brink of collapse.",

        "article": "Who is sponsoring Israeli massacres in Gaza?\r\n\r\nThe only path to ending a vicious cycle of apartheid and bloodshed against Palestinians is to guarantee Palestinian freedoms and justice on their own terms, period\r\n\r\nAs Israeli occupation forces step up massacres in Gaza and leverage U.S. weapons to advance their genocide, Washington is busy selling falsehoods to the world. Brazen support for Israel’s genocide is increasingly powered by an endless pool of U.S. propaganda on occupation self-defense, meriting a categorical rebuttal.\r\nNowhere is this more apparent than at present. The United States recently proposed a draft UN Security Council resolution to sidestep Palestine, lobbying to legitimize the Israeli blatant war crimes under the garb of self-defense. Those ambitions have hit a brick wall, and arrive at a time when the White House pursues some $10.6 billion in funding to fuel the Israeli genocide. All this reveals the extent of U.S. sponsorship and its criminal indifference toward ending bloodshed in Gaza.\r\nFirst, pumping billions into the arms of the occupation will only empower Palestine’s resistance to lead a powerful and legitimate response for unaccounted Palestinian blood. The pursuit for unwarranted Pentagon funding is clear proof that the United States wants to counter calls for an immediate end to occupation brutalities. It already discouraged its diplomats from calling for ceasefire or de-escalation in the war.\r\nThe most visible example of glaring U.S. warmongering is its decision to veto a UN Security Council resolution on a humanitarian truce in the Gaza Strip. Entire families have been wiped out, and at least 4,650 Palestinians in Gaza breathed their last. The more that the U.S. glorifies occupation massacres against besieged Palestinians, the stronger the resistance’s legitimate response to Israeli aggression and brutality.\r\nIt is a fact that the internal front of the Israeli occupation entity is in shambles. The Palestinian resistance, through its ongoing operation, has raised the likelihood of the occupation army relinquishing its grip over thousands of illegal settlements on the Southern front. That weakness is one of many strategic low points that have unsettled the Israeli security establishment and prompted regional fighters to pursue retaliatory strikes against the Israelis' illegal killings of scores of journalists.\r\nWashington is in no position to sell the toxic fiction that it is pursuing humanitarian aid options for Gaza. In reality, it is lending a shoulder to the Israeli occupation to prepare for an unwarranted ground offensive, bearing all the costs of such state-sponsored terror. Given the Palestinian resistance’s track record of foiling blatant adventurism in recent memory, Washington risks preparing the ground for its own military undoing by contributing to an ongoing massacre against Palestinians.\r\nThe sacred land of the Palestinians is no theater for indiscriminate airstrikes and bloodshed. A resistance consolidated in the face of Israeli belligerence shall defend Palestine’s right to prevail and triumph through thick and thin. Any attempt to expand the occupation footprint will not only backfire with twice the force. Rather, it confirms that Washington is the chief obstacle to Palestinians’ inalienable right to return to “their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted,” as per UN resolution 3236.\r\nMake no mistake. The only path to ending a vicious cycle of apartheid and bloodshed against Palestinians is to guarantee Palestinian freedoms and justice on their own terms, period. The decades-old resistance is a classic example of that pursuit. Washington’s refusal to even account for such a de-escalation prospect is clear in its blatant lobbying for billions in pro-occupation support. Moreover, Washington identifies as deeply complicit by committing U.S. forces in support of Israel’s planned ground adventurism. “The United States has conveyed to Israel its intention to deploy additional American forces to the Middle East, in readiness for a ground operation due to concerns over the escalating ... attacks against its forces in the region,” said the Israeli army radio recently.\r\nPalestinian lives are no collateral, and U.S. sponsorship of a ground invasion will be answered in full. Early signs entail the coming together of distinct resistance forces against Israel in key parts of the region. That includes a Lebanese resistance that is leading from the front. Fighters continue to expose tactical weaknesses among occupation forces at the Palestinian-Lebanese border area and play a vital role in disrupting the Israeli security establishment’s Gaza invasion scheme. Scores of U.S. lawmakers continue to cheer destructive rhetoric against besieged Palestinians, removing all doubt about Washington’s desire to turn the current wave of occupation belligerence into a multi-front regional conflict.\r\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can posture all he wants but hollow threats of conflict against the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance will never hold up. It is that same occupation status quo that has led to perpetual Palestinian suffering for decades, culminating in a tipping point today where state-sponsored terrorism is as clear as day. In an act of cowardice that contradicts U.S. claims to stability in the region, Israel touted falsehoods about striking the resistance with such “strength that it cannot even imagine.”\r\nMajor chapters from history, such as Israel’s damning defeat in the 2006 war, drive such occupation posturing to the ground. Above all, the genocide is a wake-up call for all those cheering Israeli escalations in Gaza, blinded by the consequences that follow.",

        "article": "Arabs & Muslim Diaspora in Canada: What is Next After the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza?\r\n\r\nThe Canadian politicians' rhetoric of human rights, equality, and respect for international laws is a smoke screen that hides their active complicity with genocide and colonial interests.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, it did not take long for Western colonial powers and settler colonial institutions to show their true colonial selves. Nor was it surprising to see the systemic violence against any attempt to call out state colonialism or institutional complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. The regurgitating statements of “unequivocal support” to the active genocide of the Israeli settler colonial apartheid \"state\" against Palestinian people, following the October 7th, 2023 attack against Israeli settlements in Occupied Palestine, were sickening.\r\nThe statements of support from Western colonial powers are active participation in colonial genocide against Palestinian people; they are also acts of violence against their citizens meant to silence any attempt to resist settler colonialism and call out its institutional violence that is now actively promoting the continuation of genocide against Palestinian people on live TV. The Arab and Muslim diaspora in Canada and the West, together with all activists voicing their rejection of the ongoing ethnic cleansing in Palestine felt this silencing strategy.\r\nThe Canadian position showed us again the deep roots of Canadian colonial heritage. All political parties and institutions in Canada made similar statements that support the Israeli rights to self-defense and the vast condemnation of Hamas. Even worse, Canadian politicians maintained their support after watching the butchering of Palestinian children on live TV. All Canadian political parties, mainstream media, and institutions, including university administrations, are complicit in the ongoing genocide. Nothing you do will ever clear the path for peace, human rights, and dignity of all people as long as you continue to demonstrate double standards to support a racist settler colonial apartheid regime.\r\nIs it hard for political leaders and elected officials in Canada to call for an immediate ceasefire? Watching the Israeli army slaughter children on live TV does not move them? Didn’t the Israeli leaders and war criminals' depiction of the Palestinians as “human animals” and “children of darkness” remind them of anything? What about the active ethnic cleansing and collective punishment of 2.3 million people who have already been under extreme conditions of a brutal siege that cut food, water, medicine, fuel, and any hope for survival? The Canadian politicians' rhetoric of human rights, equality, and respect for international laws is a smoke screen that hides their active complicity with genocide and colonial interests. Their record of protecting their colonial interest has never been more evident, all thanks to the Palestinian resistance and \"Israel's\" brutality.\r\nThe Canadian colonial system continues being a colonial warmonger against what most citizens hope for. For a country to play an active role at the global level, it must decide whether to be a colonial power serving its colonial agenda or a country to stand with the marginalized and oppressed; Canada has chosen! The rhetoric of equity, diversity, and inclusion that politicians vocalize contradicts their colonial practices, rendering their position very clear: keep Canada a settler colonial state that exploits international laws and human rights for its colonial agenda.\r\nCanadian mainstream media is not innocent either; they have had many opportunities to represent what is going on in Gaza within the context of settler colonial struggle. Yet, not surprisingly, they chose to parrot propaganda that led to the ongoing genocide against Palestinian children and civilians. Even after the systematic Israeli massacres against Palestinians have been crowding TV and social media sources, Canadian mainstream media chose to support Israeli settler colonialism in Palestine and ignore international laws, international human rights agencies calling out Israeli apartheid, and the many UN declarations that support Palestinian self-determination and rights to independence. Ironically, Canadian and mainstream Western media continually lecture us about their commitments to truth and respect for Human rights and international laws. Yet, we have seen blatant propaganda that fosters Muslim and Arab dehumanization and rhetorical discourses that promote genocide and ethnic cleansing in Palestine.\r\nIn a recent rally in Canada supporting the Palestinian struggle, a speaker said: “If Israelis stop fighting, we may have peace, but if Palestinians stop resisting, we will have no Palestinians left.” Let this statement sink in! As we reflect, let’s remember all the people who have been lost to colonial genocide and all those who struggle with colonial violence and erasure.\r\nAmid the ongoing racist colonial Israeli genocide against Palestinians, we bear witness to the blood that has been shed. We bear witness to all the pain and suffering of every mother who lost a child, every sister who lost a brother, and every child who lost their parents. We bear witness to every land stolen, every broken bone, and every fetus killed in anticipation before birth to prevent the emergence of a new generation of Palestinian resistance. We bear witness to all the crimes against humanity that the Israeli colonial state and its allies justified in the name of self-defense. We bear witness to the dehumanization that justifies cultural cleansing and crimes against humanity.\r\nWe bear witness to all this and more to stand and fight together. We will not be silenced; we will not cave to threats and we will not fear the colonial violence that seeks to silence and erase us. We bear witness to the hope we see in people on the streets calling out “not in our names”; we see that hope materializing in the face of Western colonial systems.\r\nIn this messed up world, we bear witness to reject hate and colonial violence and stand up against genocide. We bear witness to ensure we leave future generations a just world. We witness the hope in all the resistance movements standing up against genocide, colonial violence, and systemic eraser.\r\nTo our people in Palestine, to our people in Gaza: defenders of human rights worldwide are united so that you live, resist, and fight for your freedom and dignity.",

        "article": "Dragged to the edge of the abyss\r\n\r\nPalestine had no break for 75 years, while the Western ‘international rules-based order’ watches, does nothing to stop it, and everything to ensure it continues.\r\n\r\nNo words are left. The mind is emptied of anything more to say beyond repetition after 75 years of this. Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, no break. Ethnic cleansing, en masse and incremental; massacres, assassinations, bombing of refugee camps, schools, clinics, hospitals, ambulances, paramedics, cities, towns, and villages, bombed by artillery, tanks, jet fighters, and warships. Mothers, fathers, children, babies, brothers, sisters, cousins, grandparents, uncles and aunts, and friends, were all massacred. No break for 75 years, while the Western ‘international rules-based order’ watches, does nothing to stop it and everything to ensure it continues.\r\nThere was horror and outrage in 1982 when the settler regime’s iron guard stalked through Sabra and Shatila refugee camps slaughtering men, women, and children. This woke the Western world up to the crimes it was capable of committing but then it slept throughout all the crimes that followed, until October 7, when Palestinians launched the first relatively large-scale attack inside the occupied land in all those 75 years. Then the horror and outrage knew no limits, but only at the killing of Israelis, not at the killing of Palestinians by them.\r\nOn one side of the Gaza fence about 1,400 Israelis were killed, on the other 3,500 Palestinians within the first week.\r\nSince October 7 close to 100 Palestinians, many of them also children, have also been murdered on the West Bank by soldiers and settlers, secure in the knowledge that they are immune from prosecution. The settler regime ‘minister of national security’, Itamar Ben Gvir, has poured thousands more weapons into the settlements, an encouragement from this violent fascist to kill even more Palestinians.\r\nThe killing of these 1,400 Israelis, hundreds of them soldiers and police and armed civilians, with some civilians held hostage killed by their own soldiers, all of them living on stolen Palestinian land, is said to be the greatest crime against Jews since the Nazi genocide of World War Two.\r\nWhat, then, do we say about the killing of thousands of Palestinians in each of the Zionist regime’s attacks on Gaza or Lebanon? Since when, we should ask; since the last time; since Lebanon 1982, since 1967, since Gaza in the 1960s or 1950s, or since 1948, not thousands but tens of thousands.\r\nIgnoring the mass killing of Palestinians and Lebanese except for empty calls of ‘restraint,’ there is no stopping the horror and outrage when it is Israelis who are killed. Is there some explanation for why the killing of Israelis causes outrage and the (far greater) killing of Palestinians causes a scarcely veiled indifference? Is there some reason why Western governments and the Western media can’t be horrified at the killing of all children and not just some, which is certainly what it looks like?\r\nThe killers of Israelis are called ‘human animals,’ and the killers of Palestinians are only defending their ‘right’ to exist, by killing someone else. What a strange ‘right’ this is, and once certainly not extended to the Palestinians.\r\nBloodlust now pours through the Western media. The politicians join the calls for annihilation, for revenge, for killing as many innocent men, women, and children as long as it takes to wipe out the armed men. “Finish them!” cries the US presidential candidate Nikki Haley.\r\nThe media is awash in lies, lurid accusations turned into fact and repeated endlessly to normalize and validate what has to be done to tame these \"savages\". The native is running riot, has broken out of the prison, out of the reserve where he is imprisoned, and has to be taught a lesson he will never forget. Morality, law, and justice are irrelevant. This is the iron law of the colonial master.\r\nWe have the guns, planes, and warships and you don’t, ensuring the triumph of the master over the slave yet again, the techno-barbarism revealed when the smiling mask of ‘Western civilization’ slips to reveal the other/real face.\r\nThe savagery of the settler colony implanted in Palestine is a matter of record, which is why history doesn’t figure in Western media ‘explanations’ of what is happening in Gaza, not just happening but crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by that same regime.\r\nThe bombing of the al-Ahli hospital is one of the greatest single atrocities committed in the modern history of the Middle East. It was clear at the start who did it, but the West needed a lie to shift the blame and the mass murderers they arm, finance, and support at every level quickly provided it. They claimed the cause was a failed rocket launch by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Western media has run this fabrication every day despite all the evidence needed to confirm that it is a lie.\r\nA timeline analysis of live-streamed aerial activity over Gaza from 8.45 pm to 7 pm on October 17 shows that Zionist forces launched four missile strikes, at 18.54/28, 18.55/03, 18.57/42, and 18.58/04. Several rockets were fired in this period by Hamas/Palestinian Islamic Jihad, all of which were destroyed by Iron Dome. The last was launched at 18.59/35 and was intercepted 15 seconds later at 18.59/50. It can be seen breaking up in the sky.\r\nNo further rockets were fired from Gaza but five seconds after the last was destroyed, an explosion lit the sky over al-Ahli hospital, followed two seconds later by the bomb dropped or fired directly outside the hospital from a drone or plane.\r\nWhile no further evidence is needed, it needs to be pointed out that Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad have launched thousands of rockets over the Gaza fence since October 7 and not one has caused a small fraction of the damage caused by this missile. Neither of these groups has missiles of such destructive power, as the damage they cause clearly shows. The type of weapon most probably used was a JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munition), a ‘dumb’ bomb converted to precision use and configured to explode in the air just above the ground, causing mass casualties but leaving no crater as the irrefutable evidence of who must have fired it.\r\nGazan health authorities say 500-800 were massacred in the strike. The settler regime had attacked other hospitals and has a long history of bombing hospitals, clinics, and ambulances in Gaza and Lebanon and murdering paramedics and other medical personnel, so any argument that it would never commit such a terrible crime doesn’t hold water. The facts bear this out.\r\nThe al-Ahli hospital had already been bombed twice as a warning before the main missile attack. The hospital’s director says he was told by phone: “We warned you yesterday with two bombs. Why have you not evacuated the hospital until this moment.” Husam Na’um, Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, said that the hospital had been issued with three evacuation warnings before the main attack. On Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, hospital staff had been contacted, mostly by phone, and told to leave before the premeditated attack on their workplace.\r\nA spokesman for the \"Tel Aviv\" regime said a week ago that “the emphasis is on damage not accuracy.” This is being borne out every day. Central Gaza city looks like Warsaw after the Nazis bombed the city in 1939, with the difference that far more bombs, and far more destructive bombs, have been dropped on Gaza.\r\nThe lack of concern for human life is the same. Thousands of Gazans have been killed, whole families have been wiped out across generations so that their names no longer exist on the population register. Convoys moving to southern Gaza after being told they would be safe there have been massacred in air attacks.\r\nDespite these truly heinous crimes, western governments are standing by the criminals and not the victims and urging them to go even further even though this has now moved from an aerial onslaught to genocide.\r\nThere is good reason to suspect that Netanyahu and the violent Jewish supremacist cohort around him knew this attack was coming and allowed it to take place so under the cover of war the settler regime could drive Gaza’s civilian population into Sinai and take Gaza for itself. This is an open demand now being made, but so far Egypt’s President Sisi has refused to allow it. Like the lies of 9/11, this might be the underlying reality of what the settler regime calls 9/11. Netanyahu was also in serious political and personal trouble on the home front, where he is being prosecuted for bribery, fraud, and taking kickbacks.\r\n\r\nThe onslaught on Gaza\r\nThe Rafah gate remains closed except for the possible transit of humanitarian aid but there is nothing to stop it from being bombed once the war starts on the ground so a terrorized civilian population can pour through.\r\nEven before the bombing of the al-Ahli hospital, nearly 1,000 Palestinian children had been killed in missile strikes. Whole families have now been massacred across generations so there is no name left on the population register.\r\nFar from being horrified at the slaughter and throwing out the ambassadors of the regime responsible for these crimes, Western governments, behind their pious calls for restraint and proportionality, allow the attacks to continue as long as their psychopathic little friend doesn’t go too far. What is too far, they don’t say. How many dead children would be proportionate, no one asks.\r\nStep by step the nuclear-armed settler regime implanted in Palestine, against the wishes and over the heads of its indigenous people, has led the Western world to the edge of an abyss. Russia and China will not step in to save it when it goes too far but Europe and the US have tied themselves to its wheels and will be dragged over the cliff with it, along with everyone else, in the region and beyond.",

While Netanyahu did not commit to a specific exchange deal, he claimed to the families that authorities would make every effort to bring the captives home.\r\nEarlier, relatives of some of the 229 Israeli captives in Gaza staged a protest and urgently appealed for a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Security Minister Yoav Gallant, and other members of the war cabinet.\r\nThis request comes as \"Israel\" carried out deliberate strikes that disrupted communication networks in Gaza, while occupation forces declared an \"expansion\" of ground incursions into the Strip.\r\nIsraeli media reported that protesters demanding the release of captives and the dismissal of Netanyahu blocked a road near the Ministry of Security in \"Tel Aviv\".\r\nThe families expressed concern for the safety of their family members as the Israeli war machine launched an unprecedented bombing of the Strip last night, which they described as \"the most terrible of all nights.\"",

According to Al Mayadeen's correspondent, the number of Palestinians martyred by the aggression exceeded 6,000, with around 20,000 wounded, amid catastrophic health conditions.\r\n\r\n'Homeland defenders are not terrorists'\r\nSayyed Khamenei also cautioned Muslim governments against adopting the US and certain other Western nations' practice of designating the \"defenders of the homeland\" as 'terrorists\".\r\nHe forewarned Muslim governments and political spokespeople to exercise caution when quoting Western governments' statements and to believe that Palestine will undoubtedly prevail in this and future operations.\r\n\"Is a person who defends his home and country against the enemy a terrorist? The terrorist is that fake and cruel government that occupied his house,\" he asserted.\r\nHe concluded that Palestine, not the Israeli entity, will be in control of the future world and that the Palestinians will triumph despite \"Israel's\" atrocities and crimes.",

And that has always been a gross misrepresentation, we have to recognize, for example, that the United States is a party to the conflict on the side of Israel,\" he said, noting that billions of dollars in military aid and intelligence are being given to the Occupation.\r\n\"That provides diplomatic cover, including in the Security Council, to prevent any action to hold Israel accountable,\" he continued, adding, \"It's just an illusion to suggest that they can play any other role.\"\r\nMokhiber went on to say that that applies to Europe as well.\r\n\"As we've seen in the recent onslaught in Gaza, instead of seeing European leaders standing up, including the leaders of the United Kingdom, and of the European Union, standing up to defend human rights, we've seen them stand up to defend the aggression, the gross violations and the breaches of humanitarian law that Israel has been committing in the occupied territories,\" he stated.\r\n\r\n'Two-state solution' not sustainable\r\nMore importantly, according to Mokhiber, every individual in the United Nations knows that the possibility of a \"two-state solution\" is not a valid option for peace.\r\n\"You know, in the UN, you have this kind of a smokescreen. Everyone in the corridors knows that there is no longer a possibility of a sustainable two-state solution... Yet, if they speak in public or to journalists, they just keep repeating the mantra of the two-state solution. Everyone in the UN knows that the Quartet had effectively not existed and yet they refer to the Quartet.\"\r\nHe continued to describe the current situation as a struggle between an \"occupier and the occupied\" and between the oppressor and the oppressed, \"between one of the most powerful states and militaries in the world on the one hand, and dispossessed and disempowered, civilian indigenous population on the other hand,\" he said.\r\n\r\n'Turning a blind eye'\r\nAccording to Mokhiber, international human rights organizations recognize \"Israel\" as a system of apartheid, which \"has been affirmed by every international human rights organization, Israeli human rights organizations, Palestinian human rights organizations, and by a number of UN Human Rights mechanisms.\"\r\nHowever, no action is taken and the repercussions are given a blind eye.\r\n\"And yet in the approach of the United Nations, the political side of the United Nations, all of this is ignored,\" he said.\r\nThis comes after Mokhiber sent a letter on Tuesday to Volker Turk, High Commissioner for Human Rights, resigning in protest due to the UN's perceived inability to prevent the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\r\n\"This will be my last communication to you,\" Mokhiber wrote in his resignation letter to the UN high commissioner in Geneva, Volker Turk on October 28.\r\n\"We are seeing a genocide unfolding before our eyes, and the Organization that we serve appears powerless to stop it,\" he added. Mokhiber has expressed concern over the unfolding genocide and called for efforts to combat apartheid and establish a single, secular, democratic state in historic Palestine based on human rights for all its people.",

Nutrition screenings conducted at shelters and health centres in the north found that 15.6 per cent – or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age – are acutely malnourished.\r\nOf these, the report adds, almost 3 per cent suffer from severe wasting, the most life-threatening form of malnutrition, which puts young children at highest risk of medical complications and death unless they receive urgent treatment. As the data were collected in January, the situation is likely to be even graver today.\r\nSimilar screenings in the Southern Gaza Strip, in Rafah, where aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years are acutely malnourished. This is clear evidence that access to humanitarian aid is needed and can help prevent the worst outcomes. It also reinforces agencies’ calls to protect Rafah from the threat of intensified military operations.\r\n“The Gaza Strip is poised to witness an explosion in preventable child deaths which would compound the already unbearable level of child deaths in Gaza,” said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, Ted Chaiban.\r\n“We’ve been warning for weeks that the Gaza Strip is on the brink of a nutrition crisis. If the conflict doesn’t end now, children’s nutrition will continue to plummet, leading to preventable deaths or health issues which will affect the children of Gaza for the rest of their lives and have potential intergenerational consequences.”\r\n“The steep rise in malnutrition that we are seeing in Gaza is dangerous and entirely preventable”, said WFP Assistant Executive Director for Programme Operations, Valerie Guarnieri.\r\n“Children and women, in particular, need continuous access to healthy foods, clean water and health and nutrition services. For that to happen, we need decisive improvements on security and humanitarian access, and additional entry points for aid to enter Gaza.”",

Zulic emphasized that the museum aims to inspire action against genocide and promote a call for peace.\r\n“We are truly proud that our museum inspires people to end the genocide, call for peace, and understand the need for peace,” said Zulic. “The world must realize the real need to protect civilians and victims.”\r\nZulic pointed out the lack of substantial efforts to prevent genocide, ethnic cleansing, and human rights violations in Gaza, stressing the urgency of global intervention.\r\nThe ongoing Israeli genocidal offensive has resulted in a devastating toll, with nearly 30,000 Palestinians killed, as many as 70,000 injured, and with nearly 1.8 million people internally displaced.\r\nThe curator reiterated the museum’s message that action must be taken promptly to ensure peace and protect civilians, particularly women and children.\r\nThe Israeli government faces accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice, with an interim ruling in January urging Tel Aviv to halt genocidal acts and ensure humanitarian aid reaches civilians in Gaza.",

        "article": "WHO: Gaza’s health system hanging by a thread amid the ongoing Israeli genocide, military siege\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization has warned that Gaza’s health system is hanging by a thread as health facilities throughout the Palestinian enclave cease to function, restrictions to access increase, medical supplies dwindle and cuts in other humanitarian aid essential for patient care grow.\r\nGaza’s Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where an Israeli military operation is ongoing, is one of the latest casualties. WHO, together with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and the Palestine Red Crescent Society, recently conducted a high-risk mission to the medical facility to bring fuel and other essential supplies and evacuate patients in danger from the facility.\r\n“The transfer of patients was requested by the hospital staff after the facility became nonfunctional following a military raid February 14, after a week-long siege,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said on Tuesday.\r\n“Weak and frail patients were transferred amidst active conflict near the aid convoy. Road conditions hindered the swift movement of ambulances, placing the health of patients at further risk,” he said.\r\nRik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory who was part of the medical team, said the three-day mission was frustrated at every turn by military personnel around the compound.\r\nIn a telephone interview from Cairo on Monday, Peeperkorn told VOA that his team had requested access to the hospital several times to talk to the staff, “do a quick medical assessment, plan a medical evacuation and transfer patients when needed.”\r\nHe said the team was not allowed access for the first two days but was granted access to the hospital on the third day. He said the team managed to transfer 14 critical patients — eight nonwalking and six walking, along with two patient companions — to four other hospitals in the area.\r\nWHO estimates that 130 sick and injured patients and at least 15 doctors and nurses remain inside the hospital.\r\nPeeperkorn described conditions in the hospital as dire and deteriorating.\r\n“The ICU is not functional,” he said. “The hospital has no electricity. We brought in some medical supplies. It has actually very little food and water, no basic supplies for oxygen, no running water, and there is garbage everywhere, creating a breeding ground for disease. There is also heavy damage everywhere.\r\n“The limb reconstruction, which was the pride of Nasser Medical Complex, where a lot of amputations were prevented by excellent surgeons, is not functional anymore. Currently, you can say that the hospital, which is the largest referral hospital south of central Gaza, is not functional,” he said.\r\nOCHA reports that the situation in Al Amal Hospital, also in Khan Younis, is also critical, following a four-week siege by the Israeli military. Food supplies reportedly are almost exhausted, and fuel reserves are dwindling.\r\nAnother serious issue is malnutrition. A joint WHO, UNICEF, World Food Program report issued Monday warns that “a steep rise in malnutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women in Gaza Strip poses grave threats to their health.”",

Fewer trucks have entered Gaza and fewer aid missions have been permitted to reach northern Gaza in the several weeks since the ruling than in the weeks preceding it, according to United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\r\n“The Israeli government is starving Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians, putting them in even more peril than before the World Court’s binding order,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “The Israeli government has simply ignored the court’s ruling, and in some ways even intensified its repression, including further blocking lifesaving aid.”\r\nOther countries should use all forms of leverage, including sanctions and embargoes, to press the Israeli government to comply with the court’s binding orders in the genocide case, Human Rights Watch said.\r\nHuman Rights Watch found in December 2023 that Israeli authorities are using starvation as a weapon of war. Pursuant a policy set out by Israeli officials and carried out by Israeli forces, the Israeli authorities are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food, and fuel, willfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to its survival.\r\nAfter initially cutting the entire supply of water that Israel provides to Gaza via three pipelines, Israel resumed piping on two of its three lines. However, due to the cuts and widespread destruction to water infrastructure amid unrelenting Israeli air and ground operations, only one of those lines remained operational at only 47 percent capacity as of February 20. Officials at the Gaza Coastal Municipalities Water Utility told Human Rights Watch on February 20 that Israeli authorities have obstructed efforts to repair the water infrastructure.\r\nBetween January 26 and February 23, more than 3,400 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to figures from Gaza’s Health Ministry compiled by OCHA.\r\nSouth Africa’s case against Israel for genocide is distinct from the proceedings on the legal consequences of Israel’s 57-year-occupation, which began at the ICJ on February 19.\r\n“Israel’s blatant disregard for the World Court’s order poses a direct challenge to the rules-based international order,” Shakir said. “Failure to ensure Israel’s compliance puts the lives of millions of Palestinians at risk and threatens to undermine the institutions charged with ensuring respect for international law and the system that ensures civilian protection worldwide.”",

        "article": "Amnesty: Israel must end its occupation of Palestine to stop fueling apartheid and systematic human rights violations\r\n\r\nIsrael must end its brutal occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which it has maintained since 1967, said Amnesty International, as public hearings begin at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to examine the legal consequences of Israel’s prolonged occupation.\r\nThe public hearings are taking place in the Hague from 19 to 26 February after the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in December 2022 to request an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the legality of Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) and the consequences of Israel’s conduct for other states and the UN. More than 50 states, the African Union, the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are scheduled to participate in the proceedings.\r\n“Israel’s occupation of Palestine is the longest and one of the most deadly military occupations in the world. For decades it has been characterised by widespread and systematic human rights violations against Palestinians. The occupation has also enabled and entrenched Israel’s system of apartheid imposed on Palestinians,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.\r\n“Over the years, Israel’s military occupation has evolved into a perpetual occupation in flagrant violation of international law.\r\n“The current conflict raging in the occupied Gaza Strip, where the ICJ has ruled there is a real and imminent risk of genocide, has brought into sharp focus the catastrophic consequences of allowing Israel’s international crimes in the OPT to continue with impunity for so long. The world must recognize that ending Israel’s illegal occupation is a prerequisite to stopping the recurrent human rights violations in Israel and the OPT.”\r\n“All states must review their relations with Israel to ensure that they are not contributing to sustaining the occupation or the system of apartheid. As European foreign ministers gather in Brussels today, the need to make a clear and united call for an end to Israel’s occupation has never been more urgent,” said Agnès Callamard.\r\n\r\nLife under occupation\r\nPalestinians living under Israeli occupation are subjected to a myriad of human rights violations, maintained by an institutionalized regime of systematic domination and oppression. The discriminatory and repressive laws, ostensibly adopted as part of the occupation but effectively serving the objectives of the Israel’s system of apartheid, have fragmented and segregated Palestinians across the OPT, while unlawfully exploiting their resources, arbitrarily restricting their rights and freedoms and controlling almost every aspect of their lives.\r\nEven before the latest hostilities, Palestinians in Gaza had been subjected to numerous Israeli military offensives – at least six between 2008 and 2023 – in addition to an enduring land, air, and sea blockade, which has helped maintain Israel’s effective control and occupation of Gaza. During those offensives, Amnesty International documented a recurrent pattern of unlawful attacks, amounting to war crimes and even crimes against humanity, while the enduring blockade constitutes collective punishment, also a war crime.\r\nIn the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, Palestinians routinely face excessive use of force, unlawful killings, arbitrary arrest, administrative detention, forced displacement, home demolitions, confiscation of land and natural resources, and denial of fundamental rights and freedoms. Israel’s multi-layered closure system, fortified by mass surveillance, physical barriers and legal restrictions, including an illegal wall/fence, hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks, and an arbitrary permit regime, has curtailed Palestinians’ freedom of movement and perpetuated their disenfranchisement.\r\nAmong the most emblematic examples of Israel’s outright disregard for international law has been the establishment and incessant spread of Israeli settlements throughout the OPT and the illegal annexation of occupied East Jerusalem immediately after the 1967 war which was constitutionally enshrined in 1980. There are currently at least 300 illegal Israeli settlements and outposts in the West Bank, including in occupied East Jerusalem, with a population of over 700,000 Israeli settlers.\r\n“For 56 years Palestinians in the OPT have been living trapped and oppressed under Israel’s brutal occupation, subjected to systemic discrimination. Every aspect of their daily lives is disrupted and controlled by Israeli authorities, who place restrictions on their rights to move around, earn a living, pursue educational and professional aspirations, and enjoy a decent quality of life, as well as depriving them of access to their land and natural resources,” said Agnès Callamard.\r\n“Israel has also continued its vicious land grab policies relentlessly expanding illegal settlements in violation of international law with devastating consequences for Palestinians’ human rights and security. Violent Israeli settlers have been attacking Palestinians for decades with virtually total impunity.”\r\n\r\nA draconian system of control\r\nIsrael’s draconian system of control over the OPT includes a large network of military checkpoints, fences/ walls and military bases and patrols as well as a string of repressive military orders.\r\nIsrael’s control of the OPT’s borders, the population registry, the supply of water, electricity, telecommunication services, humanitarian and development assistance, and the imposition of its currency have had devastating effects on the economic and social developments of the Palestinian people in the OPT.\r\nThis control has reached unprecedented levels of cruelty in the Gaza Strip where Israel has maintained a 16-year illegal blockade which has been further tightened since 9 October 2023. The blockade, coupled with Israel’s recurrent military operations have plunged the Gaza Strip into one of the gravest humanitarian and human rights crisis of modern times.\r\n“As the occupying power Israel has an obligation to ensure the protection and welfare of all those residing in the territory it controls. Instead, it has perpetrated gross and systematic human rights violations with impunity. Israel cites the need to maintain security as the reason for its cruel policies. But security can never justify apartheid, illegal annexation and settlements, or war crimes against the protected population. The only way to ensure security for Israelis and Palestinians is to uphold human rights for all,” said Agnès Callamard.",

        "article": "Deepfakes From The Israel-Hamas War Increase Fears About AI's Power To Mislead\n\nThe war in Gaza has painfully illustrated AI’s potential as a propaganda tool, used to create lifelike images of carnage.\n\nAmong images of the bombed out homes and ravaged streets of Gaza, some stood out for the utter horror: Bloodied, abandoned infants.\nViewed millions of times online since the war began, these images are deepfakes created using artificial intelligence. If you look closely you can see clues: fingers that curl oddly, or eyes that shimmer with an unnatural light — all telltale signs of digital deception.\nThe outrage the images were created to provoke, however, is all too real.\nPictures from the Israel-Hamas war have vividly and painfully illustrated AI’s potential as a propaganda tool, used to create lifelike images of carnage. Since the war began last month, digitally altered ones spread on social media have been used to make false claims about responsibility for casualties or to deceive people about atrocities that never happened.\nWhile most of the false claims circulating online about the war didn’t require AI to create and came from more conventional sources, technological advances are coming with increasing frequency and little oversight. That’s made the potential of AI to become another form of weapon starkly apparent, and offered a glimpse of what’s to come during future conflicts, elections and other big events.\n“It’s going to get worse — a lot worse — before it gets better,” said Jean-Claude Goldenstein, CEO of CREOpoint, a tech company based in San Francisco and Paris that uses AI to assess the validity of online claims. The company has created a database of the most viral deepfakes to emerge from Gaza. “Pictures, video and audio: with generative AI it’s going to be an escalation you haven’t seen.”\nIn some cases, photos from other conflicts or disasters have been repurposed and passed off as new. In others, generative AI programs have been used to create images from scratch, such as one of a baby crying amidst bombing wreckage that went viral in the conflict’s earliest days.\nOther examples of AI-generated images include videos showing supposed Israeli missile strikes, or tanks rolling through ruined neighborhoods, or families combing through rubble for survivors.\nIn many cases, the fakes seem designed to evoke a strong emotional reaction by including the bodies of babies, children or families. In the bloody first days of the war, supporters of both Israel and Hamas alleged the other side had victimized children and babies; deepfake images of wailing infants offered photographic ‘evidence’ that was quickly held up as proof.\nThe propagandists who create such images are skilled at targeting people’s deepest impulses and anxieties, said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that has tracked disinformation from the war. Whether it’s a deepfake baby, or an actual image of an infant from another conflict, the emotional impact on the viewer is the same.\nThe more abhorrent the image, the more likely a user is to remember it and to share it, unwittingly spreading the disinformation further.\n“People are being told right now: Look at this picture of a baby,” Ahmed said. “The disinformation is designed to make you engage with it.”\nSimilarly deceptive AI-generated content began to spread after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. One altered video appeared to show Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordering Ukrainians to surrender. Such claims have continued to circulate as recently as last week, showing just how persistent even easily debunked misinformation can be.\nEach new conflict, or election season, provides new opportunities for disinformation peddlers to demonstrate the latest AI advances. That has many AI experts and political scientists warning of the risks next year, when several countries hold major elections, including the U.S., India, Pakistan, Ukraine, Taiwan, Indonesia and Mexico.\nThe risk that AI and social media could be used to spread lies to U.S. voters has alarmed lawmakers from both parties in Washington. At a recent hearing on the dangers of deepfake technology, U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said the U.S. must invest in funding the development of AI tools designed to counter other AI.\n“We as a nation need to get this right,” Connolly said.\nAround the world a number of startup tech firms are working on new programs that can sniff out deepfakes, affix watermarks to images to prove their origin, or scan text to verify any specious claims that may have been inserted by AI.\n“The next wave of AI will be: How can we verify the content that is out there. How can you detect misinformation, how can you analyze text to determine if it is trustworthy?” said Maria Amelie, co-founder of Factiverse, a Norwegian company that has created an AI program that can scan content for inaccuracies or bias introduced by other AI programs.\nSuch programs would be of immediate interest to educators, journalists, financial analysts and others interested in rooting out falsehoods, plagiarism or fraud. Similar programs are being designed to sniff out doctored photos or video.\nWhile this technology shows promise, those using AI to lie are often a step ahead, according to David Doermann, a computer scientist who led an effort at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to respond to the national security threats posed by AI-manipulated images.\nDoermann, who is now a professor at the University at Buffalo, said effectively responding to the political and social challenges posed by AI disinformation will require both better technology and better regulations, voluntary industry standards and extensive investments in digital literacy programs to help internet users figure out ways to tell truth from fantasy.\n“Every time we release a tool that detects this, our adversaries can use AI to cover up that trace evidence,” said Doermann. “Detection and trying to pull this stuff down is no longer the solution. We need to have a much bigger solution.”",

        "article": "FROM COURTROOM TO CONSPIRACY: ALAN DERSHOWITZ’S TIES TO EPSTEIN’S BLACKMAIL NETWORK\n\nOn January 9, MintPress News probed a newly unsealed tranche of documentation on official police investigations into and civil lawsuits leveled against Jeffrey Epstein – specifically, papers mentioning Alan Dershowitz. At that time, the veteran Zionist legal activist had been mooted as Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu’s top pick to defend Tel Aviv at the International Court of Justice in a case brought by South Africa over the Gaza genocide before almost immediately being dumped due to wide-ranging public backlash.\nThat Netanyahu considered Dershowitz a viable candidate for the role at all spoke volumes. Both about Tel Aviv’s total lack of self-awareness and qualms over negative publicity, but also Dershowitz’s intimate connections to Israel’s darkest recesses. His role in defending notorious serial rapist Harvey Weinstein in court, and negotiating Epstein’s extraordinary 2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement, are well-known. Yet, obvious questions about whether and how these activities centrally placed him in a web of intelligence-connected blackmail intrigue have never been asked.\nWhen the fresh batch of Epstein files dropped last month, Dershowitz – about whom allegations of pedophilia have abounded for many years – was quick to boast of how his name appeared 137 times in the material while claiming the contents fully exonerated him of any wrongdoing. Even if true – and, as MintPress News’ previous investigation outlined, that is far from certain – certain documents could point to Dershowitz’s complicity in and knowledge of a very different sexual criminality.\n\n‘Leave It Alone’\nThe origins of Dershowitz’s longrunning friendship with Epstein – or the version he “likes” to tell – are revealed in a July 2019 New Yorker longread. Per Dershowitz, he was introduced to Epstein by his close associate, Lady Rothschild, Lynn Forester. In 1996, she suggested he meet an “interesting autodidact.” As an individual with “an enduring fascination with fame, society, and wealth,” he eagerly accepted the invitation.\nEpstein flew to Martha’s Vineyard and visited Dershowitz, bringing a bottle of champagne. “The two men found common interests,” The New Yorker recorded, talking about “science…academia…Harvard.” They became close friends, and in September of that year, Epstein introduced Dershowitz to his “mentor,” billionaire Leslie Wexner. Details of Epstein’s purported wealth management business remain sketchy today, to the point some question if it existed in the first place and how, given the distinct lack of a typical paper trail. Wexner was his only named “client.”\nEpstein and Dershowitz traveled to Wexner’s 300-acre estate in Ohio to celebrate their host’s fifty-ninth birthday. Other guests included astronaut turned senator John Glenn and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Dershowitz’s assessment was that he served as Epstein’s “intellectual gift” to Wexner. Epstein was ever-keen to patronize and be perceived as a patron to academia, particularly Harvard, where Dershowitz taught law from 1964 to 2013. He, sometimes with Wexner, funded new buildings and research programs at the University while serving on assorted advisory boards there.\nAccordingly, many eminent figures in academia, science and technology have been linked to Epstein, rousing suspicions they were among his VIP “clients,” for whom he arranged sexual encounters with underage victims. In explaining why the billionaire was treated so leniently in 2008, then-Florida District Attorney Alexander Acosta, who oversaw the prosecution, claims he was told Epstein “belonged to intelligence” and thus was above his pay grade. State authorities were instructed to “leave it alone” as a result.\nIntensive investigations into Epstein and his personal and professional networks by MintPress contributor Whitney Webb amply suggest that the “intelligence” to which he “belonged” was Israel’s Mossad. In her landmark, two-part work One Nation Under Blackmail, she concludes Epstein sexually compromised luminaries within U.S. politics, technology, science, and finance, with Mossad and the Zionist cause the “most likely beneficiaries of his blackmail schemes.” This connivance went some way to furthering Tel Aviv’s domestic and foreign policy goals.\nSpeaking to MintPress, Webb says Dershowitz “maintains never having known of Epstein’s deviant sexual behavior and crimes, and apparently overlooked his obvious affiliations with intelligence and organized crime, possibly because they shared a devotion to Zionism.” She adds that Dershowitz avowedly didn’t investigate “any red flags around Epstein,” as they were introduced by Lady Rothschild, a member of the family’s influential banking dynasty via marriage:\nDershowitz’s account of his introduction to Epstein suggests he deferred to Rothschild’s power and influence, over his own judgment. Some have observed how Dershowitz’s perspective is affected by issues about which he is very emotional, like Zionism. He has shown vindictiveness toward those who have publicly challenged his Zionist leanings, such as Norman Finkelstein, and even taken quotes of an Epstein victim far out of context in an attempt to brand them as anti-Semitic.”\n\n‘Credibility Enhanced’\nIn this context, Dershowitz’s dealings with Virginia Guiffre (nee Roberts), who accused him and Epstein of sickening offenses, take on an acutely sinister character. Meanwhile, his already dubious denials of knowing about “Epstein’s deviant sexual behavior and crimes” before and during their extended time as close confidantes are rendered all the more dubious.\nIn December 2014, Giuffre sued Dershowitz, claiming Epstein arranged for him to rape her at least six times, starting from when she was just 16. The legal action dragged on until November 2022, when Giuffre abruptly dropped the suit, contending she may have mistakenly misidentified her rapist. In the intervening time, parallel suits Giuffre brought against Epstein’s “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell and British Royal Prince Andrew, who also allegedly assaulted her, were settled in her favor to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nSeveral files released in January pertain to Giuffre’s jettisoned legal action, and a case her lawyers brought against Dershowitz after the Harvard law professor tried to have them both disbarred for their pro bono support of her while launching a “massive public media assault on [their] reputation and character.” In September 2015, the unsealed records show that Dershowitz argued in court submissions that, in suing him for defamation, Giuffre’s lawyers “somehow waived” attorney-client privilege with Giuffre.\nDershowitz resultantly filed a motion to compel them “to produce documents” and any material in their possession related to their client. In other words, he was determined to get his hands on sensitive, private information and communications involving his accuser, typically protected from legal disclosure. The presiding judge ultimately rejected these demands, condemning Dershowitz’s cynical effort to overturn one of the “oldest recognized privileges” in U.S. law for his own benefit.\nUndeterred, Dershowitz subpoenaed Giuffre to provide a sworn deposition, as the defamation action against him was ongoing. On the stand, she was relentlessly blitzed with queries concerned with compelling her to reveal information protected by attorney-client privilege and repeatedly invited her to waive those rights. In every instance, she declined. Giuffre’s lawyers’ action was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum in April 2016.\nOne might conclude Dershowitz was guilty as sin, desperately flailing to ascertain any dirt his accuser and her attorneys might have on him before defending serious accusations in court. This reading may well be accurate – although an alternative or even complementary interpretation could be that the Zionist legal apparatchik sought to identify what Giuffre knew more generally about Epstein’s pedophilic conspiracy in order to warn his friend and client. And perhaps Mossad, their clandestine sponsor.\nThis suspicion is somewhat reinforced by a glaring, never hitherto acknowledged contradiction. Throughout January 2015, while being sued by Giuffre for sexual abuse, Dershowitz repeatedly took to mainstream U.S. TV news networks, including ABC, daring her to reiterate her allegations against him publicly on the same channels so that he could sue her for defamation. When she failed to appear, the Harvard legal professor charged Giuffre’s silence greatly undermined her credibility, demonstrating her allegations were libelous and untrue.\nYet, in late 2019, a recording of an ABC News anchor leaked, in which she openly discussed how a planned 2015 interview with Giuffre didn’t go ahead due to direct pressure from her superiors – and none other than Dershowitz himself. He subsequently acknowledged the veracity of that account several times, contemporaneously telling NPR he “did not want to see [Giuffre’s] credibility enhanced by ABC.” Again, this is extremely sinister behavior. Was Dershowitz simply attempting to protect himself, or Epstein – and the wider blackmail intrigue?\n\n‘Frequent Guest’\nAs Whitney Webb tells Mintpress, Epstein was not the only “powerful Zionist accused of sexual misdeeds” in Dershowitz’s professional and social milieu. Harvey Weinstein, a veteran Hollywood film producer, was in October 2017 accused of industrial-scale rape, assault, harassment, and other non-consensual sexual conduct spanning a 30-year period. By the time of his arrest in May the next year, more than 80 women in the film industry had accused him of heinous acts.\nIn the intervening time, it was revealed that Weinstein had availed himself of the services of Black Cube, a private intelligence company founded by former Mossad operatives, to surveil, influence, and intimidate his litany of accusers and journalists investigating his shocking history of sex abuse, in order to suppress the scandal. A veritable army of “ex” Israeli spies and chaos agents, often using false identities, collected a wealth of sensitive information on dozens of individuals, including their personal sexual histories.\nFor example, one Black Cube operative, working undercover as a women’s rights supporter, approached film star Rose MacGowan, who was assaulted by Weinstein in a hotel room at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, claiming they were interested in hiring her for a formal dinner speech. Their conversations were secretly recorded and then shared with Weinstein. And perhaps Dershowitz, who represented the serial rapist in his February 2020 trial, which landed the disgraced mogul in jail for 23 years.\nWebb adds that Weinstein was connected to Black Cube by another powerful Zionist and Epstein associate – former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. Barak has since denied having any connection whatsoever with the company or its associates. Yet, he has a private intelligence firm staffed by “ex”-Mossad operatives all of his own – Toka. In late 2022, it was announced that the company had innovated tech capable of hacking into and altering both recorded and live CCTV footage.\nIt is deeply disturbing that Toka has mastered this abstruse art, and one can only wonder why. In the Occupied Territories, CCTV footage has frequently been used to save falsely accused Palestinians from jail. Even more sinister answers may lie in Barak’s extremely close and long-running friendship with Epstein. It has been reported that the former Israeli premier was a “frequent guest, almost a fixture” at the billionaire pedophile’s expansive New York mansion before his mysterious death, reportedly by suicide, in 2019.\nImmediately before that fateful day, Barak approached Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist and senior counselor to Donald Trump, asking them to assist in a PR blitz to exonerate Epstein. He may well have had more cynical, self-interested motivations, too. He is said to have once joked to his friend that the pair had “nothing to worry about” and they were “safe” from repercussions. In what context they reportedly made those remarks isn’t certain, although Giuffre claims Barak raped her.\nShe has also accused wealthy Victoria’s Secret owner Leslie Wexner, whose Foundation paid Barak hundreds of thousands of dollars from 2004 to 2006 for just two research papers, one of which wasn’t completed. In January 2021, Israel’s High Court rejected a petition to investigate these payments formally. Whether this financing had another, darker purpose entirely is an open and obvious question.\nMultiple witnesses and victims alike have claimed Epstein’s many lavish residences were equipped with hidden cameras and microphones, used to record sexual assaults and rapes by politicians and high-profile figures he courted. At least one source contends this footage, along with other incriminating material, was collated in personalized dossiers on Epstein’s clients for the purposes of blackmail. The billionaire’s eventual capture and the risk his powerful paymasters could, in turn, be exposed to means that Mossad would likely be wary about funding such a real-life operation again.\nThe CIA is known to have concocted numerous plots to forge sex tapes implicating foreign leaders. Toka’s tech would provide an alternative means of achieving this same Mephistophelian end, with enhanced layers of plausible deniability and little risk of public exposure. And if that were to happen, Alan Dershowitz would almost inevitably be on hand to secure Barak and his underlings’ sweetheart sentences.",

Israel has consistently used lies and fabrications to lay the blame for the Palestinian refugees on others.\nInitially, it was the fault of the “Arabs” for promising the Palestinians they could leave while the Arab armies kicked the Jews out of Palestine, after which they would be able to return. The Palestinians fell for this, so the Zionist story goes, and now it is too bad for them they cannot return. Even if this was true, it does not explain why, from the end of 1947, the Zionist terror groups were violently displacing Palestinians, nor does it explain why the refugees were not permitted to return.\nFollowing the creation of the State of Israel, the Gaza Strip, parts of the West Bank and large areas within the countries that border Palestine became homes to refugee camps. From that point on, Israel claimed that it was the responsibility of the host countries to solve the refugee crisis by integrating Palestinians. In other words, it was not the responsibility of the party that committed the crime of ethnic cleansing but of the countries that were forced to host them.\nBecause Israel occupied Gaza, it is faced with a problem it cannot solve. Doing the only thing that makes sense and allowing the refugees to return to their land and their homes is out of the question because Israel is a genocidal racist regime. Leaving Gaza as it is isn’t working either, so killing as many Palestinians in Gaza as possible and blaming it on them has been the policy for decades, and it has been successful.\nSince the early 1950s, when the Gaza Strip was created, Israeli forces have been committing massacres there and then blaming it on the Palestinians, claiming they present an existential threat. This strategy of killing has been so successful that even now, in 2024, the world is willing to allow Israel to commit acts of genocide uninterrupted.\nFurthermore, as these acts of genocide take place, Israel has succeeded in accomplishing yet another facet of its strategy to undermine the rights of the Palestinian refugees. It managed to get the world to reduce its support of UNRWA. The resources that were once available to UNRWA were barely enough to provide the services that its mandate demands. Now, the need is greater than ever, and many of the resources have dried up thanks to Israel’s undermining of the organization.\nLast but not least, Israel and its allies are accusing Egypt and even Jordan of not “taking” any of the survivors of the genocide in Gaza. It is these countries, say the Zionists, who should take the Palestinians and save them. Once again, the responsibility is shifted from the perpetrators of the crimes to parties that have nothing to do with it, while Israel enjoys diplomatic cover and material support that allows it to continue the genocide in Gaza and the brutal oppression throughout all parts of Palestine.",

        "article": "HOW CORPORATE MEDIA WHITEWASH ISRAELI CRIMES: A PERSONAL NARRATIVE\n\nLike many of you, my heart is weighed down so heavily by the ongoing turmoil in Gaza. And every day, I witness in absolute horror what Israel is doing to Palestinians, as it commits war crime after war crime; it’s watching dismembered children with their limbs blown off or helpless fathers carrying their decapitated babies while collecting the body parts of their wives and children in plastic bags. Or mothers carrying the dead bodies of their children, crying and screaming for them just to wake up. Or the newlywed wife who embraces her deceased husband, her lover, and gives him her last kiss and hug goodbye. It almost feels like we’re watching a sadistic horror movie right on the screens of our smartphones, but we’re not — we are watching in real-time a genocide of my people unfold before our eyes.\nAnd the death toll stands stark and horrific — over 20,000 Palestinians have been killed by merciless bombs, guided missiles, and white phosphorous — weapons handed directly to an out-of-control apartheid state by our government and paid for by our taxpayer money.\nIf anything good has come out of this horrific war, it’s that the moral depravity of the so-called “rules-based order” has been exposed to the masses. The mask has fallen from the Neoliberal class. For far too long, liberal Western politicians have tried to convince us that they live by the standards of human rights, freedom of speech, and democracy. These are the same individuals and countries that say Israel has a right to defend itself against the world’s largest concentration camp. Our so-called leaders in Washington, London, and Brussels have weaponized human rights to sell the world’s so-called humanitarian wars and to expand its settler colonial projects. But let’s not forget that this ruling class is what brought us the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Somalia and the brutal maximum pressure campaigns, sanctions, and regime change operations against sovereign nations like Syria, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, and so many more countries who are resisting Western imperialism. Israel’s war in Gaza is just an outward representation of what the Neoliberal class represents — a bloodthirst for war that fuels the military-industrial complex. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon applaud this genocide. Think tanks that are funded by these weapon manufacturers draft the war policies for our politicians to make these wars inevitable. We see dead children; they see their stock prices go up.\nBut it’s clear that no matter how many millions they spend to manufacture consent for their wars and support Israeli apartheid, Palestinians have won the hearts and minds of humanity. Never have I seen such global dissent and awakening to Israel’s war in Gaza. We’re seeing a global awakening. Millions have taken to the streets, mass sit-ins at our elected officials’ offices have been organized, and boycotts. The massive coffee company Starbucks lost 12 billion dollars in a matter of one month from our boycott campaign. We have to disrupt the money-making mechanisms that make these wars possible. The capitalist system is meant to make us feel powerless, but we have the power to stop this war. And Israel knows this.\nThat’s why Israel is spending millions on propaganda, but it’s also systematically targeting Palestinian journalists in Gaza. Over 100 journalists have been killed so far in less than 70 days. These courageous individuals, committed to unveiling the truth, have become direct targets of a regime desperate to cloak its genocidal actions from the world’s scrutiny. Israel doesn’t want the world to see the reality of its genocidal onslaught in Gaza, so it’s assassinating the messengers. In most parts of the world, wearing a flak jacket marked “press” gives you protection. But right now in Palestine, it may as well be a target, as Israel has turned Gaza into what the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has called a “cemetery for journalists.”\nAnd you’d think mainstream corporate journalists would talk about the targeting of journalists in Gaza, but they’re not. If legacy media outlets like the New York Times or CNN cover Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza, they don’t have the basic journalistic integrity to say who killed them and fail to point out that Israel is systematically targeting them. Corporate media are whitewashing Israeli crimes and playing the fool, pretending not to understand where the missiles come from. They pretend not to hear the genocidal rhetoric emanating from Tel Aviv, who are openly calling Palestinians subhuman who need to be cleansed out of Gaza. Brave journalists have lost their lives trying to document the Israeli onslaught — we will not forget Palestinian journalist Ayat Khadoura, who was killed in her home by an Israeli airstrike. In her “last message to the world” posted on Instagram, she said: “We used to have big dreams, but now our dream is to be killed in one piece so they know who we are.”\nToday, my dear friend and colleague journalist Motaz Azaiza has chronicled with full transparency the horrors of life under incessant bombs. And people around the world are flocking to his page to get live coverage of the war because it’s become evident that Western corporate media are biased towards Israeli apartheid, pushing atrocity propaganda about October 7th to justify Israel’s genocide… Western media leave out the context that Israel is occupying Palestinian land and fail to mention the many crimes against humanity Israel is committing every single day according to the Geneva Convention. It’s no coincidence. It’s because organizations like the New York Times Jerusalem bureau are built on a Palestinian house in al-Quds, which belongs to a noted Palestinian writer, Ghada Karmi, a survivor of the Nakba.\nThe NYT also cooperates with Israeli officials by receiving and obeying gag orders from the Israeli government. The New York Times Israel bureau chiefs Ethan Bronner, Isabel Kershner, and David Brooks had their adult children enlisted in the Israeli army while they were actively covering Israel and Palestine for the newspaper. The so-called paper of record never made this public to its readers, raising serious questions of bias and a conflict of interest. The New York Times also has a history of firing journalists like Gaza-based photographer Hosam Salem following an intervention from the Israel lobby group Honest Reporting. CNN and others who are embedded with the Israeli military have to get their footage approved by Israel before publishing it.\nThese are minor examples that don’t even scratch the surface of how other media outlets work directly with Israel to control the narrative on Palestine or even how BIG Tech works with NATO and Israeli-funded think tanks like the Atlantic Council and the ADL to crack down on alternative information on social media platforms. Consider this: In a matter of 60 days, Motaz amassed over 17.5 million followers. While the New York Times has 9.4 million digital subscribers…. We are winning the information war, and people are breaking through the propaganda. Journalists like Motaz Azaiza, Younis Tirawi, Muhammad Smiry, Motasem Mortaja, Wael Dahdouh, Hind Khoudary, and Bisan, to name a few, are showing us in real-time the courage it often takes to be a journalist.\nAs Israel continues to pound Gaza and we continue to see images of death, blood, and destruction, it’s easy to feel hopeless. It’s easy to be left speechless. But our story doesn’t end here… for every bomb dropped, every child left to survive but orphaned, limbs lost, every person pulled from under the rubble but left horrified… for every person left to survive… they survive to tell our story. We are the survivors — and our existence is our resistance. Israel thought it could bury us, but we turned out to be seeds. I was once that little girl who sat on her rooftop in Shufat–al–Quds and watched in horror Israeli jets drop bombs on homes in Ramallah. I was once that little girl who sat in her classroom only to look around to find my classmates missing each day because they were either killed or blocked from crossing a checkpoint to get to school…\nI was once that little girl who was too afraid to look outside her window as Israeli soldiers pointed their rifles toward us during a militarized curfew… I was once that little girl who had her water cut off and had to hide in her barricaded home so that Israeli settlers wouldn’t come inside and attack her family. By 13 years old, I had already witnessed human rights abuses by a state that had convinced the world it was a civilized democracy. No child should have seen what I had seen, let alone what the children of Gaza are seeing today. By 13, I had already witnessed Palestinians subjected to discriminatory laws, having their travel controlled, and living behind a 30-foot-tall concrete apartheid wall separating them from the world. Every single day was a matter of survival while living under martial law and occupation. When I finally moved back to the US when I was 13 years old – to the pristine suburbs of Minneapolis, MN – where the lawns were perfectly mowed and perfect… life was calm… but my mind was racing with thoughts of children being killed by bombs, families left homeless from airstrikes, electricity and water cutoffs. I couldn’t stop thinking about the men and young boys who were abducted by Israeli police in the middle of the night raids and held in indefinite detention without trial and on no charge. I could not unsee what I had seen.\nLittle did I know moving overseas to Palestine as an American child would shape not only my perspective on the world but how the media operates. When we moved back to the US in 2001, it was just a few months before 9/11. I was absolutely traumatized. I suffered from what soldiers who fight in wars suffer from when they return home: PTSD, severe anxiety, and survivor’s guilt. I was just 13 years old and felt like no one understood what I had witnessed. While most teenagers in America were worried about football games, shopping, and partying, I turned to the media to stay up to date on the war I could not let go of. But what I got were images of Palestinian men covering their faces and bearing guns, stoking fear in the hearts of Americans while framing Palestinians as the aggressors. Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC gave Israeli leaders, and political figures paid millions of dollars by the Israeli lobby unlimited airtime on their networks to spew dehumanizing rhetoric about Palestinians and how much we hated ourselves, and that we wanted our children to die.\nThe media instilled fear in the hearts and minds of Americans to paint us as savages and barbaric to help justify Israel’s apartheid and fascist policies on a defenseless population. Why wouldn’t they? The US gives Israel over $10.4 Million a day to the apartheid regime. After 9/11 – the media propaganda machine went on steroids to dehumanize Muslims as barbaric and painted a caricature of jihad narrative about us to justify the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – that left 4 million people dead. It became clear that Americans’ lack of understanding about the world was because of the media… And it’s as if they are all given the same script to talk about wars overseas. It’s no wonder six corporations own 90% of what Americans see, hear, and read. Americans are the most propagandized people on the planet.\nNow, despite feeling alone, traumatized, misunderstood, and at times almost losing hope when I was 13, having lived under Israeli occupation and now living in a post 9/11 America, watching in horror on my TV screen US bombs being dropped on Iraq and Afghanistan…. It was this rock bottom place where I found courage and catharsis in pursuing journalism to speak up not just for Palestinians but for all people around the world who are living under war. It was at 13 years old that I decided to become a journalist. And in 2009, against all odds, I became the first American woman to wear the hijab while anchoring and reporting the news in the US. While I thought this was a great accomplishment at the time, I soon realized that very little change could be made within corporate media that is directed by marketing strategies and not actual journalism. I would just become the face of diversity at these stations while pushing dumbed-down stories to the masses.\nThis is why I started MintPress soon after when I was 24 years old – and about ten years later, MintPress is now a leading independent investigative news outlet in this country and around the world that exposes the profiteers of the war machine. Our investigations have been cited by politicians, major news organizations, academic journals, books, and much more across the globe. Our reporting has been used in negotiations between the US and Russia that helped stop a full-blown US invasion of Syria. But this route hasn’t been an easy one – my name has been dragged through the mud, I’ve been labeled and smeared… I’ve appeared on the front pages of major media outlets with my face plastered next to Bashar al-Assad, calling me an agent of Iran, of Hamas – you name it. MintPress has been targeted financially by British intelligence, who ordered Paypal to ban us – we’ve been banned by Tiktok, and our Wikipedia page has been written and edited by Israel lobby groups. I’ve lost friends on the way and have had my own family turn against me for standing staunchly against war and not falling for sectarian division.\nBut this is by design – it’s a psychological war against the truth-tellers to intimidate us into stopping – to push us into a corner. No matter the information war waged against us, we will not back down because there are innocent lives at stake who need us to be their voice. Journalism became my outlet for the helplessness that I felt growing up when I suffered from PTSD, the trauma that I carry because of my life in a war zone and knowing that so many people I left behind in Palestine are still suffering, whether it be in Gaza or anywhere in the world living under war. Israel thought it could bury us, but we turned out to be seeds.",

        "article": "DISINVITATION: This Republican wants to stop Biden from giving State of the Union address\n\nEvery year, the President of the United States gives a State of the Union Address before Congress, in a tradition that dates back to the Constitution and has existed in a form similar to its current one for more than 100 years. This year, the speech is scheduled for March 7th.\nNow, Republicans are ready to break that tradition and Constitutional standard for purposes of partisan pettiness.\nRepresentative Scott Perry (R-PA) is proposing that President Joe Biden be barred from giving the address, which has shifted over the years from being, as the name implies, an update to Congress on the condition of the nation, to a rally on policy and platform.\nPerry, however, says that this is done only with the invitation of Congress, and since Republicans have control of the House of Representatives, they should just disinvite the president.\nThere have been times over the years that the State of the Union — described in the Constitution as the president’s duty to “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient” — has not been in the form of a public speech. In fact, President Thomas Jefferson started a tradition of sending the message as a written report, and that continued until Woodrow Wilson returned to the practice of in-person statements in 1913, according to Congress’ history.\nThus, President Biden will have no trouble meeting his Constitutional obligation, even if Perry’s plan comes to fruition — he could simply send a written or recorded address.\nPerry’s petty proposal would only serve to send a blatant message of partisanship and refusal to work together for the good of the American people.\nDonald Trump, who was humiliated when Nancy Pelosi tore up a copy of his SOTU speech as he completed it, would love the show of support, but voters might not appreciate their elected representatives priorities.\nIt could also be seen as a message that Republicans are really afraid of what message the president might send to the American public in the last SOTU of this term, as he vies for another.\nWatch Perry explain his idea below. \n[X post] \"He comes at the invitation of Congress. Republicans are in control of the House. There's no reason that we need to invite him\" — Rep. Scott Perry wants House Republicans to cancel SOTU\n",

Trump files appeal of fraud judgment, but there’s STILL a hiccup\n\nDonald Trump’s lawyers have filed an appeal in the New York business fraud case where he’s been ordered to pay almost half a billion dollars in disgorgement and interest, but so far, there’s no sign that the self-proclaimed multi-billionaire has put up the bond the state typically requires in such cases.\nThere’s also been no stay issued, meaning that unless and until one is, he’s still expected to pay up.\nThroughout the case, Trump has argued that his financial statements actually document lower-than-accurate values for his properties, rather than higher, as the prosecution showed. His team tried to write off a falsification of his penthouse size (and therefore value) as a mistake, rather than a months-long repetition of exaggerated numbers, and in fact, one of his witnesses and co-defendents, Allen Weisselberg, is reportedly in talks for a plea deal that would require him to admit to perjury on the witness stand.\nTrump has focused heavily on attacks on the judge, and on claims that the judge and prosecution have misapplied law and treated him unfairly. He claims he was improperly silenced when Judge Arthur Engoron forbade him to launch public and potentially defamatory attacks on his staff, and fined him for continuing to do so, and that the judge ignored higher court rulings. PBS reports:\n“Trump’s lawyers have long argued that some of the allegations are barred by the statute of limitations, contending that Engoron failed to comply with an Appellate Division ruling last year that he narrow the scope of the trial to weed out outdated allegations.”\nTrump’s primary defense of himself, however, has consistently been less about his own actions than those of the prosecution and the justice system. He’s claimed that this and all of his criminal and civil cases are merely fabrications created by or on behalf of President Joe Biden, for political purposes.\nThe former president is known for drawing cases out, forcing other parties to rack up legal costs and spend their time answering endless filings, but in this case, MSNBC‘s Lisa Rubin points out, he may be costing himself, instead. She reported:\n“But there is no stay of the judgment yet. Because under NY court rules, defendants typically must post an undertaking, or bond, in the amount of the judgment or even more, as New York courts typically require. And there’s zero indication anyone has done so yet.”\nIn other words, Trump will still have to pay up, one way or another — either into a court-held account that could be refunded in the hypothetical chance that he’s able to get the ruling overturned somewhere along the way, or as a settlement of judgment.\nNow he just has to either find the money in his existing accounts, sell assets to come up with the cash if he doesn’t have enough to post a bond, or find a financial institution (or foreign government) willing to loan him the money for his appeal.",

        "article": "Navalny Dies and NATO Nazi War Pimps around the World Mourn\n\nNavalny, Alexei, age 47, convicted on several counts of embezzlement, contempt of court, parole violations, and the founding of an “extremist organization,” died in the Arctic [brrrrr] Prison – “toughest penal colony” – on 16 February, and NATO politicians, diplomats, and their house servant media stenographers have all donned their professional mourners attire.\nVarious uncorroborated sources have reported that Navalny had taken a nice walk, returned to his cell feeling ‘unwell,’ and abruptly died from a “blood clot” or an “arterial clot,” without further explanation.\nThe smattering of NATO mourners of the former exterminator who considered Muslims “cockroaches,” deserving of being shot to death, include the usual gang of Western supremacist hypocrites.\nFor those in need of further clarification of Navalny’s ”activism,” here is a short clip of one of the Nazi demonstrations he led and addressed, prior to his incarceration: [video]\nAmong these professional NATO mourners are US Senator Thom Tillis, who supports continuing funding of Nazi Ukraine and who supported the war criminal bombing of Syria – without Congressional approval – for al Qaeda in the Levantine Republic; French intelligence asset, Bernard Henri Levi, friend of al Qaeda in Libya, friend of armed insurrectionist separatists SDF in Syria; the not-democratically-elected EU head, Ursula von der Leyen actually called for the [NATO] world to “stand up against autocracy” (Syria News notes that the first EU head was literal Nazi, Walter Hallstein. After seeing that the NYT previously described the convict by his “Nordic good looks, the author has not had the stomach to check on its obit for him).\nNavalny was serving a 30 years combined sentence for his collective convictions. The ”extremist organization” he founded in 2011 was named the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), an NGO funded by undisclosed, private, sources. On 9 October 2019, Russia’s Ministry of Justice declared FBK a “foreign agent.”\nOn 9 June 2021, the FBK was declared “extremist” by the Moscow City Court and liquidated. One year and one month later, Navalny relaunched his NGO internationally.\nThe NATO reputed “opposition leader” almost became a household name in the summer of 2020 (almost, as it is unpronounceable in most Western tongues, though visually recognized by all, courtesy of NATO-affiliated media), when he was weirdly ‘stricken’ on a plane in Siberia – outlandishly screaming according to a WaPo video report (at 16 seconds, here) – before ‘falling into a coma’ (which later became an ‘induced’ one), and requiring an emergency stop by the plane so he could be escorted by ambulance to a nearby hospital. NBC News reported that a Russian physician claimed Navalny had a “metabolic disease,” possibly caused by “low blood sugar” (a tad on the asinine side, as B-grade movie screams are neither part of losing consciousness from hypoglycemia, nor part of Metabolic Syndrome), followed by the claim that he was poisoned by a Novichok “nerve agent” that somehow was not quite Novichok, though the implied, unidentified, variant held the same “cholinesterase inhibitor” as Novichok. As Syria News reported in December 2020, such a neurotoxic inhibitor “five to eight times more toxic than VX…[which] can kill a person within minutes” (per 13 March 2018 BBC report).\nIf one’s muscles have been paralyzed by a deadly and fast-acting nerve agent, one can not breathe. If one can not breathe, one can not scream. If one is poisoned with an anticholinergic more toxic than VX, he will not be cured getting atropine two weeks later…because he will be dead.\nIn what can only be considered the most stunning of coincidences, Navalny’s wife/widow just happened to be in attendance for the [NATO] Munich Security Conference (MSC) 2024. She was conflicted over whether to believe the report her husband was dead, whether to immediately return to her children, to comfort them, or to give an impressive speech to the attendees (an old Syria News report included some salient points of the NATO MSC 2016 meeting and its fetid involvement in anti-Syria war propaganda).\nThe obviously from the heart, unprepared speech of Navalny’s new widow, attacking Putin, despite not knowing if the rumors of her husband were exaggerated, warranted a massive and sustained standing ovation from the NATO think tankers in attendance, and an air kiss from Nancy Pelosi:\nThis author was so touched by the raw emotion that she immediately moved to the MSC’s website, to discover it was founded sixty years ago…and by a literal Nazi!\nEwald von Kleist joined the Nazi military at the age of 18. He became an officer in the Nazi military. He fought the anti-Nazi USSR on the Russian frontline. NATO-affiliated The Guardian‘s obituary did its best to avoid the term, Nazi, instead, choosing to bloviate about “passive resistance” and “reluctantly serving in the Wehrmacht…” and ending by calling this Nazi an “army officer.”\nNATO was created to keep fascism alive, and much of humanity, dead.\nThis simple sentence, from one report, has never exuded a symmetry as has been seen, today, 16 February 2024.\nOn this date, the sudden death of neo-Nazi and convicted criminal, Alexei Navalny was announced.\nLiteral Nazi supporters – war criminal politicians, un-diplomats, phony liberal NGO activists are prostrate with grief.\nNavalny’s widow happens to be a speaker at the NATO think tank founded by a Nazi officer and provides an impromptu eulogy and attack on Russia’s president, simultaneously.\nThe NATO Nazis in attendance give neo-Nazi Navalny a standing ovation.",

Among the casualties of this war crime were women and children, some under the age of five.\nThe al Suweida Fire Brigade and first responders spent hours engaged in rescue and recovery, digging Syrians out from what was once their homes, turned to rubble by the Casino King of Jordan.\nMedia sources claimed that the bombing targeted drug traffickers operating across the borders between the two countries.\nTaking into consideration the fact that Jordan is not a destination country for drugs, the Gulfies and mainly Saudi Arabia is, and the timing of suspicious repeated Jordanian heavy military operations against ‘drug traffickers’ including aerial bombing, tanks, and infantry clashes lasting for hours in each time, and the proximity to the Israeli borders, military and political analysts are more convinced that these Jordanian military operations are meant to intercept weapons smuggling by Palestinian factions into occupied Palestine thus Jordan is helping secure Israel from escalations, mainly in the West Bank, something the Jordanian incumbent king continues his father’s legacy in doing, his father King Hussein was CIA handle was ‘Mr. No Beef’ and was paid handsomely in return for his ‘valuable services’ for the USA.\nEver heard of an army of a country heavily engaging drug traffickers across the borders of another country to stop the flow of those drugs through its territories to other countries?\nThe Jordanian authorities could have simply shared their ‘intel’ on drug traffickers with the Syrian authorities who would be more than happy to act upon such information and take out the criminals with more success avoiding any casualties among civilians. Syrian law enforcement has a very impressive track record of combating drug trafficking sponsored by NATO through Syria since the beginning of the US-led war of terror against Syria.\nA bit of history is required to explain how Western supremacists have come to consider Jordan a “good Arab” country: On 15 May 1923, British occupation forces hacked off a chunk of Palestine and named it The Emirate of Transjordan, its protectorate. In 1946, the UK gave the region the status of Hashemite Kingdom, a protectorate. How the region was made to be ruled by royal blood is beyond the scope of this report – beyond minimally noting that such royal creation involved the British Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and pre- al Saud Arabia (the aforementioned empires and Egypt all had their drippings in the establishment of this kingdom, also).\n“Jordan joined NATO’s Mediterranean Dialogue partnership forum in 1995 and is one of NATO’s closest partners in the region,” and has most blatantly functioned as its tap-dancing House Servant throughout the foreign war of terror against Syria, launched in March 2011. Though Abdullah II joined President Barack Obama’s war criminal coalition against Syria only in September 2014, he allowed the US to use Jordan as a training ground for ISIS terrorists, led by terrorist al Baghdadi, who was released from an Iraqi jail by American invaders and given twenty million dollars to teach new terrorists, under the supervision of the US Marine Corps.\nAs the CIA’s Operation Mockingbird remains a stunning success in the United States, we remind, especially, our American readers that in early 2015, war criminal Jordanian pilot Muath al Kasesbeh was shot down by the friendly fire of Major Mariam “Boobs on the Ground” al Mansouri, the first female bomber pilot of that hodge-podge of a seven-state federation of absolute monarchies known as the UAE, after which Abdullah II stuffed himself into military garb in order to further threaten Syria with a blood-thirsty line from a Clint Eastwood movie. Two months later, Jordan launched a blitzkrieg massacre of two hundred thirty Syrian Arab Army soldiers in the UNESCO Heritage Site of Bosra al-Sham – greatly helping ISIS.\nNATO-affiliated Scum Media have normalized Jordan’s war criminal bombings in their uni-voice claim that ”drug dealers” were targeted, and that Iran and Hezb Allah are behind the illicit drug traffic.\nThe following photos are taken from the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Courtesy of a scum mayor and a scum prosecutor, this working-class neighborhood has been turned into a dumping ground for homeless addicts, has been made into the tranq capitol of the world, a place where illicit drug dealing is permitted to be done in the open, as long as dealers and junkies do not kill each other.\nThis neighborhood has become known for tranq tourism as xylazine spreads throughout the country.\nWestern Syria News readers might consider whether NATO-affiliated media would legitimize Canada bombing this US neighborhood under cover of magically fighting drug dealing, and might consider the normalization of a foreign country meting out the death penalty to suspected drug dealers and innocent people in the surrounding.\nWhy is Jordan allowed to get away with murder, get away with war crimes, when the same would never be tolerated among NATO countries?\nThe answer is obvious: Jordan functions as a NATO – especially US NATO – house servant, and NATO continues to want to impose a new Sykes-Picot on Syria. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al Safadi balked at Syria returning to the Arab League and he lied about Captagon as his cover story (Syrians, by the way, were not thrilled by the return to a league of Syria-hating NATO operatives).\nSyria News first reported on the western drug Captagon on 28 April 2013. During these ten years, we have published countless reports on Syrian law enforcement confiscation of Western Germany created methamphetamine potentiated by bronchodilator, theophylline, yet Scum Media persist in lying this drug that turns ordinary terrorists into cannibals and other psycho- and sociopaths is the fault of Syria, and are upping the ante by the addition of the war propaganda that Iran and Hezb Allah are involved.\nYesterday morning, at dawn, Jordan bombed Syria for NATO, under the auspice of being entitled to commit war crimes to fake halt drug dealing.\nJordan turned homes into rubble and murdered ten Syrians.\nJordan did so with impunity, and with the approval of NATO-affiliated stenographers.",

At approximately 0420 Damascene time, the Zionist entity created by the British empire bombed “points south of Damascus” from the illegally occupied Syrian Golan.\nA military spokesperson said in a statement:\n“At approximately 4:20 a.m. today, the Israeli enemy launched an air bombing from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting a number of points south of Damascus.”\n“Our air defense forces responded to the aggression’s missiles and shot down some of them, and the losses were limited to material losses”\nAt this writing, Syria’s air defense system – which still does not include S300s – intercepted most of the missiles. Reports on this latest attack minimally state that losses are limited to material ones.\nAlso at this writing, only one non-Syrian source has bothered to mention Israel’s most recent war crime against Syria. Arab News, published in Riyadh seems to have done so solely for the purpose of citing the thrice convicted felon who jumped bail during his fourth trial in 2000, after which he found a cushy job functioning as a Brit intel operative, funded by the EU, who calls himself the SOHR. The man who escaped a fourth felonious conviction, who left Syria twenty-four years ago, has announced that “2 pro – Iranian forces killed.”\nIsrael bombing Syria from Syria, is actually a double war crime, as it continues to occupy a large portion of the Syrian Golan — where IDF trauma surgeons save lives of ISIS terrorists before sending them for free follow-up and rehabilitative care in Rambam Hospital — as the UN has never forced the fulfillment of UNSCR 242 (1967). This still naive writer recently came to hypothesize that the NATO klan ruling the United Nations was amenable to making this a unanimous resolution because it never intended to enforce it.\nSyria News readers may wonder if Israel’s increase in war criminally bombing the Levantine republic, from its standard biweekly atrocities to a mere four days respite, might be related to the toll that has shown two hundred thirty-three IDF’ers killed in the ground invasion of Gaza, since its launch.\nThough the Zionist state claims its withdrawal of thousands of potential cannon fodder soldiers from Gaza is related to mouth noise “pressure” from the US, it is more likely that the death and maiming numbers of its soldiers have become intolerable to Israelis.\nTo be completely frank, Israeli troops are ill-equipped for actual military fighting, as its soldiers have become habituated to shooting unarmed civilians, including Israeli Jews who have demonstrated against apartheid:\nOn 2 February, at 0420, Israel committed another double war crime against the Syrian Arab Republic.\nOnly time will tell when Israel’s cowardice, backed by the world’s two leaders in genocide – the US and the UK – will be halted.",

Dr. Al-Atassi explained that there are no accurate statistics yet as the ambulance and civil defense teams continue their work to recover the injured and treat them.\nLocal sources in the city of Homs reported, by the time of this report, that a child, a woman, and two men were confirmed murdered in the bombing, and there are still several martyrs under the rubble, Syrian Civil Defense teams are working to recover their bodies.\nMeanwhile, the US and NATO-controlled United Nations Security Council is mute, Russia and China are voicing their verbal disapproval of Israel’s repeated aggressions against Syria with no tangible steps to pressure Israel in their capacity as permanent members of the UNSC entrusted by the world to preserve peace and security, and the fact that Israel relies heavily on their economic and political relations, and the US cronies are dancing to the death of innocent people on the altar of the Antichrist.\nThe Israeli aggression is understood in light of the nature of the Zionist satanic cult in control of most of the Western world and their forefront proxy state in the heart of the Arab world dubbed Israel, also, seeing their demonic anti-Christ project collapsing after spending trillions of dollars throughout the past century to create and sponsor this criminal project, especially in the wars of aggression in the past couple of decades, the Zionist leaders like the incumbent US president are ready to engulf the whole world in wars to keep their killing machines working, de-population is one of their main goals.\nThe humiliating defeat Israel was handed by a group of Palestinian fighters in Gaza in the “6 hours war” on the 7th of October last year and the ensuing failure in achieving any of the goals set by its leaders despite the hundreds of massacres it has committed against the people of Gaza in its ongoing genocide, added to it the exposure of the real nature of the Zionist project and the paper tiger its Western sponsors have proved to be, globally and in the region, are all reasons why Israel and its sponsors are trying desperately to expand their war before they implode internally and lose their dream project.\nIsrael’s proxy NATO-sponsored terrorists in northwestern Syria are being picked out by the Syrian armed forces and their allies, those proxy Al Qaeda and ISIS (ISIL – Daesh) terrorists were the army of Dajjal (the Antichrist) Israel was depending on to weaken its nemesis in Syria and Iraq, therefore, the direct intervention of the anti-Jewish state and its NATO sponsors has been the case each time those proxy terrorists are on the verge of extermination.",

        "article": "Hamas's Twisted Hostage Chess\r\n\r\nOn the menu today: Over the Thanksgiving break, a series of Israeli concessions was sufficient to get Hamas to release roughly 60 hostages, including four-year-old American Abigail Edan. But it’s hard to feel jubilant with so many hostages — including Americans — remaining in captivity, Hamas getting rewarded for abominable behavior, and the sense that Hamas has a new way to pressure Israel by dangling the release of more hostages and adding new demands. Fifteen minutes into the ceasefire, someone fired a rocket at Israel from Gaza and the world barely noticed; no one really expects Hamas to uphold its end of the agreement. Go figure — barbarians who massacre unarmed civilians and use rape as a weapon of war aren’t the kind of people you can trust at the negotiating table.\r\nIt is good that so far, roughly 60 of the estimated 240 hostages held by Hamas have been released. Their captivity sounds horrific — held underground for seven weeks, barely fed, sleeping on chairs, and denied the ability to go to the bathroom for hours; some in need of medical care, including one elderly woman in life-threatening condition — and anything that relieves their suffering is a step in the right direction. But, as some warned, under the terms of the agreement, Hamas now can determine how much longer the pause in fighting continues. Israel agreed that for every ten additional hostages released, its forces would continue the cease-fire for another day.\r\nOn paper, this is a good incentive structure designed to maximize the number of hostages released. In practice, this means Hamas can always dangle the potential release of some of the estimated 180 remaining hostages and then drag its feet in actually releasing them. On Saturday, the second round of releases was delayed for about eight hours because Hamas accused Israel of not delivering trucks of humanitarian aid.\r\nBut that evening, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs confirmed that “sixty-one trucks hauled aid to northern Gaza on Saturday — the largest number since 7 October. . . . Eleven ambulances, 3 coaches and a flatbed were delivered to Al Shifa hospital to be used to assist with evacuations. Also on Saturday, another 200 trucks were dispatched from Nitzana, with 187 of them successfully entering Gaza by 19:00 local time.”\r\nWhat happens if, as the deadline approaches, Hamas offers to release nine hostages instead of the previously agreed ten? Or eight, or five, or just one? Is Israel willing to restart the fighting when there is an offer of a released hostage on the table? How will the families of the hostages respond? How will Israeli society respond?\r\nThe Associated Press, this morning: Two Egyptian officials said talks are aimed at extending the cease-fire for another four days, with one saying that both sides have agreed in principle. But that official added that violence in the occupied West Bank is complicating matters, with Hamas demanding an end to Israeli military raids. Hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested and scores killed in clashes with Israeli forces since the war began.\r\nThe original terms of the deal didn’t specify anything about what Israel could or could not do in the West Bank.\r\nIsrael contends that Hamas also broke its promise to release parents and children together: Kibbutz Be’eri, where 12 of the 13 hostages released last night were kidnapped from on October 7, says that while the community was “happy and excited” about the return of the hostages, Hamas violated the terms of the deal when it released 13-year-old Hila Rotem without her mother, Raya... Also released last night were 17-year-old Noam Or and his 13-year-old sister, Alma. Their mother Yonat was murdered by terrorists on October 7, and their father Dror remains hostage in Gaza, along with his 18-year-old nephew Liam.\r\nNote that roughly 15 minutes after the cease-fire went into effect, someone — perhaps Hamas, perhaps some other anti-Israel terror group like Palestinian Islamic Jihad — fired a rocket into Israel. Thankfully, it was intercepted; Israel did not treat it as a violation of the terms of the agreement.\r\nHamas’s modus operandi is clear: Look for any conceivable reason to claim the Israelis aren’t upholding their end of the agreement, and then use that as an excuse to break its own promises and/or make further demands.\r\nThis is not merely an Israeli problem. There are ten Americans, including one legal resident, who are unaccounted for; some of these Americans are believed to be held by Hamas. Yesterday, President Biden’s national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on CBS News’ Face the Nation, “I have every confidence that ultimately, all of the Americans and all of the individuals being held hostage will come home. We are determined not to rest until that happens.”\r\nYou may have noticed that you haven’t heard much about these ten unaccounted-for Americans. You could make an argument that saturation coverage of these hostages, with yellow ribbons and all the rest, would increase the leverage of Hamas and increase pressure on the Biden administration to offer concessions to it. But if that is the philosophy at work in the relatively low-key coverage of American hostages, it is exceptionally convenient for the administration and the president, whose job-approval rating is at 38.9 percent.\r\nAs of 2 a.m. Eastern this morning, the coordinator for the hostages and missing in the Israeli prime minister’s office issued a statement declaring, “Discussions are being held on the list that was received overnight and which is now being evaluated in Israel.” In other words, negotiations with Hamas are ongoing. When the deadline arrives, will the Israelis be willing to get up from the table and restart military operations? Or will there be too much pressure to make more concessions to get at least a few more hostages released?\r\nThe mission of either destroying or incapacitating Hamas is far from finished. David Horovitz of the Times of Israel offers a grim assessment of how much work remains: For now, it would seem, seven weeks into the Israeli effort to tear it apart, Hamas seems to be holding together quite effectively. The best estimate is that perhaps 4,000-5,000 of its gunmen are dead; that leaves another 20,000-25,000 who are not. Israel controls much of northern Gaza, and has destroyed much of Hamas’s infrastructure there, but most of the Hamas tunnel network in the north may well still be intact. According to former generals including Amos Yadlin, Yisrael Ziv and Giora Eiland, the ground operation is certainly not even half-completed, with central and southern Gaza yet to be tackled, notably including Hamas strongholds such as Khan Younis. And the logistics of fighting in southern Gaza, now unprecedentedly populated with its own residents and hundreds of thousands of evacuees from the north, will present immense challenges to the IDF, even as almost all of the international community steps up pressure for a permanent ceasefire.\r\nOver at the United Nations this weekend, our ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, pointed out the obvious: that the U.N. has quickly forgotten about what started the war, and shows no desire to hold Hamas accountable for its war crimes: It has been less than two months since Hamas carried out its barbaric terrorist attack against Israel, but many members of this Council seem to have forgotten or attempted to erase the horrors of that day. And many still cannot bring themselves to unequivocally condemn Hamas’ acts of terror. So, I feel an obligation to speak on these horrors lest we forget. It is outrageous and it is an insult to the victims of Hamas’ brutal attack. The children who were executed in front of their parents. The families who were burned alive. The young people who were gunned down with glee. We have also seen horrifying footage that points to Hamas’ rape and sexual assault of innocent civilians. Where is the universal condemnation? And where is the outrage?\r\nAt National Review today, Danielle Pletka, a distinguished senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, asks just what the point of U.S. membership in the United Nations is, if the institution is forever going to give a pass to terrorist groups like Hamas: Doubtless there are useful things that happen at the United Nations, though it takes some effort to conjure up their impact — whether in Syria, where half a million died with barely a murmur from the international body’s leadership; in North Korea, where millions have died at the hands of a brutal dictatorship; in Xinjiang, where a million Uyghur Muslim Chinese remain in Communist concentration camps, suffering the silence of the world’s most important human-rights bodies; or in Ukraine, where a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council preys on a sovereign state’s land. Sure, the U.N.’s structure insulates the Security Council’s five permanent members from attack. But then, is it not right to ask what exactly the U.N. does for human freedom, or, more practically speaking, for the U.S. taxpayer? Hating Israel and exonerating tyrants is hardly in the best interests of American foreign policy. Perhaps it’s time to stop paying the U.N. as if it actually serves American interests in any way, because it doesn’t.\r\nElsewhere at NR, our Haley Strack is observing the “U.N. Women’s 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence” by spotlighting 15 women’s organizations that have either supported Hamas’s violence against Israeli women or remained silent on it. Today’s offering is on the so-called Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund: The Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund (WPHF) is a financing arm of the United Nations that funds local women’s organizations worldwide. With an emphasis on preventing conflict and ending gender-based violence, WPHF has supported Palestinians across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip for years... In the wake of Hamas’s brutal attack against Israel, WPHF announced it would mobilize $10 million to support Palestinian women. The organization has made no similar appeals to help the women and children in Israel who were brutalized on October 7.\r\nIf you only want to help the Palestinians, never want to help the Israelis, and can never bring yourself to denounce Hamas’s most brutal and inhumane actions, then you are functionally pro-Hamas.",

Syrian air defense foiled another Israeli bombing west of Damascus a couple of hours later.\nA Syrian military spokesperson said in a statement conveyed by the Syrian news agency SANA:\n“At approximately 9:40 this morning, the Israeli enemy launched an air attack with a number of missiles from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan, targeting a residential building in the Kafr Sousa neighborhood in Damascus. The aggression resulted in the death of two civilians, the wounding of another, and the causing of material damage to the targeted building and some neighboring buildings.”\nLocal sources reported hearing the sounds of four explosions confirming there are no Iranian IRGC anti-terror or military advisors residing in the targeted building which happens to be opposite a school and a kindergarten drawing attention that the students were frightened of the sounds of the bombings and the falling debris.\nMultiple sources reported that a few hours after the first Israeli aggression, the Syrian Arab Army’s air defense units shot down several Israeli aerial targets without elaborating whether it was incoming missiles or drones.\nThe sources said that the targeted area was in the Al-Dimass area in the western countryside of Damascus, the same area that Israel targeted on the 10th of February.\nIsrael and its US-led Western sponsors are looking for any means to expand the Israeli genocidal war on Gaza to engulf more countries in the region in an attempt to save the Israelis from the quagmire they caught themselves in Gaza which also exposed the reality of the Western project dubbed Israel.\nThe Israelis, on their part, insist on repeatedly reminding the people of the region, the real Semites, of the true nature of these foreign settlers imported from Europe, Russia, and elsewhere to act as the forefront military base of the fading evil empire of lies, former colonialists, and hypocritical fake democracies in the West.",

Some 4,650 others were injured as a result of the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nGaza power plant shuts down\r\nThe single power plant in Gaza shut down on Wednesday due to a lack of fuel, according to Jalal Ismail, the director of Gaza's energy administration.\r\n\"The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped at 14:00 [11:00 am GMT] due to lack of fuel,\" Ismail remarked.\r\nEarlier in the day, Palestinian Health Minister Mai Salem al-Kailah stated that the plant's stocks had just 10-12 hours' worth of gasoline, threatening \"a humanitarian catastrophe for two million people.\"\r\nThe fuel supply for electric generators at Palestinian medical institutions will last until Thursday, according to the Minister, after the Israeli occupation enforced an electrical blockade in response to the Palestinian Resistance's Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.\r\n\r\nIsraeli strikes damage 7 water facilities: OCH\r\nSeven Gaza Stripe facilities that provided water to 1.1 million people were damaged by Israeli strikes, according to a statement released on Wednesday by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\r\n\"Israeli airstrikes have also damaged seven facilities that had been providing water and sanitation services to over 1,100,000 people. In some areas, sewage and solid waste are now accumulating in the streets, posing a health hazard,\" the OCHA said in a report.",

We stand ready to move in additional assets as needed,\" he revealed after his administration pledged to send the naval vessel to help the Israeli occupation.\r\nBiden on Sunday affirmed that the United States supports \"Israel\" and is committed to providing the necessary aid to ensure its continued aggression against the Palestinian Resistance.\r\n\"The United States stands with \"Israel.\" We will not ever fail to have their back, we will make sure that they have the help their citizens need, and they can continue to defend themselves,\" Biden said during a press conference.\r\nHe went on to call Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, launched by Hamas against the Israeli occupation \"sheer evil\" while completely disregarding all the actions taken by the Israeli occupation against Palestinians.\r\n\"There are moments in this life - I mean this literally - when a pure unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world,\" he said during a speech from the White House. \"This is an act of sheer evil.\"\r\nBiden still failed to mention that the Israeli occupation was brutally killing civilians, using white phosphorus, and bombing religious sites and schools where people typically seek refuge in times of war.\r\n\"Let me say again, to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation. I have one word, don't. Don't. Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear,\" he stressed, possibly responding to the statements that came out of Iraq and Yemen, to name a few, regarding offering help to Palestine.\r\n\r\nSupport for Palestine\r\nThe Yemeni people are ready to do everything in their power to fulfill their sacred duty of standing by the Palestinian people, the Yemeni Ansar Allah leader Sayyed Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said during a speech commenting on the latest developments in occupied Palestine.\r\n\"Our people are ready to mobilize in the hundreds of thousands and join the Palestinian people to confront the enemy, and we will not hesitate to do whatever is possible,\" he added.\r\nThere are red lines when it comes to the situation unfolding in Gaza, and there is coordination between the Axis of Resistance, he said. \"We are coordinating with the Axis of Resistance, and if the Americans make a direct military intervention, we are ready to participate, even with missile strikes and drone strikes.\"\r\n\"It is a duty to support the Palestinians with everything in our possession, and it is not permissible for this nation to stand by while Western countries help the criminal enemy,\" Sayyed al-Houthi stressed.\r\nMoreover, Sayyed al-Shuhadaa Brigades of Iraq warned Monday Washington against any interference in Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.\r\nAccording to Lebanese news outlet Al-Ahed, the group stressed that \"Palestine is not Ukraine\" and that any interference or support the US extends to the Israeli entity would make US bases in the region targets for the Resistance.\r\nThe Group expressed that any support would be met with retaliation and zero red lines would remain uncrossed.",

We have to prepare for every possible contingency.\"\r\n\"It's why the president moves so rapidly and decisively to get an aircraft carrier into the eastern Mediterranean, to get aircraft into the Gulf, because he sent a very clear message to any state or any actor that would seek to exploit this situation,\" he added.\r\nSullivan has already announced today that US President Joe Biden intends to send a package to Ukraine and \"Israel\" worth $2 billion.\r\n\"Well, the number is going to be significantly higher than that, but it will, as I said, certainly include the necessary military equipment to defend freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in Ukraine, and to help Israel defend itself as it fights its terrorist threat.\"",

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the next Israeli government “is going to have to put us back on a path to have a Palestinian state. That’s not easy, but it is the only way forward for Israel, is the only way forward for long-term peace.”\nWell, it’s not the only way forward, right?\nIsrael could clamp down on Palestinian autonomy until the violence against innocent Jewish civilians stops, and residents start living peacefully with their neighbors and begin accepting history’s outcomes.\nThat’s another option.\nWhile the situation today is appalling, creating a three-front Iran-backed terror state on the borders of a nation the size of New Jersey would make things significantly worse.\nNo sane citizenry would sign off on such a suicidal policy.\nNo genuine ally would pressure a friend to do it.\nBut that is exactly what a new country called “Palestine” is destined to be: an Islamic autocracy and, more than likely, a proxy of Iran (which may well have nuclear weapons at some point).\nPerhaps Murphy is unaware that the last time Israelis handed autonomy of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority in 2005 — ejecting thousands of Jews who would otherwise have been murdered by the only “ethnic cleansers” in this conflict — it quickly lost power.\nAnd does any sentient person believe that Hamas or the Islamic Jihad or Muslim Brotherhood-proper wouldn’t end up running a Palestinian state again?\nDoes Murphy want to send in US troops to Gaza when they do?\nBecause Israel, compelled to act on the inevitable provocations from this freshly created nation with unfettered access to weaponry, surely would.\nThe resulting war would be deadlier than the one going on now.\nRest assured, when Hamas runs a state in the West Bank that bumps right up against major civilian Jewish populations, it won’t be “us” — certainly not a Connecticut politician’s home — targeted by missiles.\nThese days, we keep hearing how Hamas is a tyrannical organization that doesn’t truly represent the will of the Palestinian people.\nIf they only had real elections, things would be different.\nThis, too, is either a lie or wishful thinking.\nWhile Hamas might not be quite as popular with Palestinians as it is with American Ivy League students, it nevertheless garners significant support.\nIn 2021, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 53% of Palestinians believed Hamas was “most deserving of representing and leading the Palestinian people,” while only 14% preferred the somewhat less terroristic Fatah.\nMost polls show similar or more enthusiastic support for Hamas.\nIt’s the reason there hasn’t been an election in the West Bank in over a decade.\nHamas would win.\nEasily.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Palestinian culture is steeped in generational, self-destructive, virulent animosity toward Jews that manifests in waves of extremism and violence.\nThis was the case in the early 20th century when Arabs began sporadically massacring Jews before Israel existed, throughout the 1940s when Palestinian leadership embraced Hitler and during a post-war faux nationalism phase (also before Israel existed), in the 1960s when the Palestine Liberation Organization introduced the world to modern terrorism (before “occupied territories” existed), and to the present Islamist iteration of that violence.\nYet Palestinians and their defenders remain the only people in the world who think they can reset history every time they lose a war of aggression.\nTheir very claim to a state is contingent on the myth that Israel invaded and “occupied” the West Bank and Gaza (and Tel Aviv) in an act of colonialism, when the “occupied territories” were taken in defensive wars against Egypt and (the existing Palestinian-majority state of) Jordan.\nBut forget history.\nForget that you can dig anywhere in the ground and find ancient Jewish artifacts.\nForget that Israel offered Arabs back the land on numerous occasions in exchange for basic recognition.\nMore importantly, there is zero evidence that Palestinian self-governance will lead to more peace — quite the opposite, in fact.\nMurphy’s notion that the only way to bring about coexistence is to reward the vilest act of Jewish murder since the Holocaust speaks to the destructive, insular, morally confused nature of the Brookings-approved DC blobthink.\nEvery time the sides revisit the negotiations on the terms dictated by these people, it ends in disappointment and, inevitably, violence.\nFortunately, this state can’t be willed into existence by Hamas-friendly newspaper editorial boards, nor by resolution-happy tyrants at the United Nations.\nAnd that’s fine. Just as there is no independent Hungarian nation in Transylvania and no Republic of Basque, there may never be a “Palestine” — or rather, a second Palestine (Jordan being the first).\nNothing says there has to be.\nYes, the situation might be intractable right now.\nBut that is no reason to make it worse.",

These are the sickest of the sick,\" it said.\r\nMany thousands more, also with wounds or other health needs, cannot access any kind of care, the WHO noted.\r\nFurthermore, the four health ministry hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip are already at or beyond capacity, and lack the critical care capacity and supplies needed to treat additional patients, said the WHO.\r\nWHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic earlier told reporters in Geneva that the Gaza Strip's health system was now at \"breaking point\", with six of the seven main hospitals only partially functioning.\r\nWHO calls for \"an end to hostilities and violence in the Gaza Strip, where unimaginable human suffering is unfolding\" the spokesman said.\r\n\r\nTime 'running out'\r\nConcern is rising over the worsening humanitarian crisis in the long-blockaded Palestinian enclave, where Israel has now imposed a total siege, cutting off water, food and energy supplies.\r\nWith dwindling supplies of food, water and health services and without adequate shelter, people will be \"at heightened risk of disease\", said the WHO.\r\nThe UN agency's pre-positioned supplies in Gaza have mostly been consumed.\r\nThe WHO is calling for an immediate humanitarian corridor to be established into the Gaza Strip.\r\nSupplies which WHO had pre-positioned in Gaza have mostly been consumed.\r\nThe organisation has prepared medical supplies for more than 300,000 patients with a range of wounds and diseases at its logistics hub in Dubai. It stands ready to deliver them to Arish in Egypt -- close to the southern Rafah crossing into Gaza.\r\n\"Time is running out to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe if fuel, water, food and life-saving health and humanitarian supplies cannot be urgently delivered to the Gaza Strip amidst the complete blockade,\" said Jasarevic.",

But the political stakes on this visit are arguably far greater.\r\nThe Democratic president deliberated carefully before accepting the invitation to visit from right-winger Netanyahu. The risk is that Biden finds himself too closely associated with an Israeli invasion of Gaza, which is already being subjected to a withering campaign of air strikes that have leveled swaths of the enclave and killed more than 2,700 people.\r\n\r\n'Right time'\r\nAsked if Washington expected Israel to wait until after Biden's trip to launch any ground offensive, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, \"we're not dictating terms or operational directions to the Israelis.\"\r\nBiden's display of support for Israel also crashes against a potentially contradictory aim: ongoing US and international efforts to ease the devastating impact of the war on Palestinian civilians.\r\nHe has in recent days increased pressure on Israel to protect civilian lives from the air strikes and a siege that has left Gaza at risk of a humanitarian disaster.\r\n\"The president believes that this is exactly the right time to go to Israel and to go to Jordan,\" Kirby told CNN on Tuesday.\r\nBiden will \"speak to other leaders in the region, about the humanitarian assistance that we want to make sure gets into Gaza, about Israeli plans and intentions going forward,\" he added.\r\nIn Jordan, Biden will meet King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, as well as Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas.\r\nTalks with Sisi are likely to focus on his refusal so far to open the Rafah border crossing to Palestinians massed in southern Gaza as they flee the expected Israeli invasion.\r\nJordan's royal court voiced hopes that the four-way summit could help \"revive the peace process\" between Palestinians and Israel, which has been at a standstill for years.\r\nThe world, and America's rivals like China and Russia, will be watching the results of Biden's trip closely.\r\nThe US president however has rejected questions about whether Washington would be overstretched by supporting allies at war in both Israel and Ukraine.\r\n\"We're the United States of America for God's sake. The most powerful nation in the history of the world,\" Biden said in an interview broadcast on the CBS News program 60 Minutes at the weekend.",

It is a must; fuel needs to be delivered now into Gaza to make water available for 2 million people,” said Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA Commissioner-General.\r\nThe aid agency said clean water started to run out in Gaza after its water plant and public water networks stopped working. Many Gazans are now forced to use dirty water from wells, increasing risks of waterborne diseases.\r\nThe United Nations said “tens of thousands” of Palestinians had fled their homes while more than 400,000 had already been displaced before the Israel Defence Forces gave an order to evacuate.\r\nOn Friday, Israel launched its first ground attacks into Gaza after Hamas carried out an assault on southern Israel on Saturday, killing at least 1,300 people and injuring more than 3,000.\r\nAt least 2,215 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and 8,714 have been wounded, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\r\nPalestinians queue to refill on water in Rafah refugee camp in Gaza on Saturday.

I emphasise that this is only the beginning,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.\r\n“The IDF conducted raids in Gazan territory to eliminate the threat of terrorist cells and infrastructure. Soldiers collected evidence that will aid in locating hostages,” Israel Defence Forces posted on X.\r\n\r\nCampaign group throws red paint over BBC HQ\r\nCampaign group Palestine Action has claimed responsibility for red paint which was thrown over the BBC’s London headquarters ahead of a pro-Palestinian march today.\r\nWriting on X, formerly Twitter, the group said: “Palestine Action left a message overnight for the BBC: spreading the occupation’s lies and manufacturing consent for israel’s war crimes means that you have Palestinian blood on your hands.”\r\nOver 50,000 people are expected to attend the pro-Palestine march in London today, according to the organisers.\r\n\r\n‘Innocent’ Gazans will die, UK Israeli embassy admits\r\nIsrael is not targeting civilians but ‘innocent’ people will die in its offensive against Gaza, the Israeli Embassy to the UK admitted.\r\n“There will be innocent people who will pay tragically with their life, but this is a state of war and we have to prevent anyone from harming us again,” Orly Goldschmidt, spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy to the UK, told Times Radio.\r\n“You know ‘never again’, this sentence we have said after the Holocaust, it’s happening at the moment, and never again is now and we need the full support of the international community because these are murderers and we need to make sure they won’t have any capacity ever again to harm.”\r\n\r\nIDF ‘aware’ of journalist killed in Israeli strike\r\nThe Israeli Defence Forces said it was ‘aware’ that a Reuters video journalist was killed and six other journalists were injured in southern Lebanon on Friday when missiles fired from the direction of Israel struck them.\r\n“We are aware of the incident with the Reuters journalist. We are looking into it. We already have visuals. We’re doing cross-examination. It’s a tragic thing,” a spokesperson said.\r\nIssam Abdallah was killed while providing a live video signal for broadcasters. The camera was pointed at a hillside when a loud explosion shook the camera, filling the air with smoke, and screams were heard, the news agency said.\r\n“We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer, Issam Abdallah, has been killed,” Reuters said.\r\n\r\nHezbollah could cause ‘huge earthquake’ for Israel, Iran says\r\nIran’s foreign minister on Saturday called on Israel to stop its attacks on Gaza, warning that the war might expand to other parts of the Middle East if Hezbollah joins the battle, and that would make Israel suffer “a huge earthquake.”\r\nHossein Amirabdollahian said he met Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah who briefed him on the group’s conditions in Lebanon. “I know about the scenarios that Hezbollah has put in place,” Amirabdollahian said. “Any step the Hezbollah will take will cause a huge earthquake in the Zionist entity.”\r\nAmirabdollahian added: “I want to warn the war criminals and those who support this entity before it’s too late to stop the crimes against civilians in Gaza, because it might be too late in a few hours.”\r\nIsrael considers Hezbollah its most serious immediate threat, estimating it has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles that can hit anywhere in Israel.",

They can be harder to spot and to work out when they are about to act, McCallum said.\r\nUS officials say they have already seen a rise in reported threats in the wake of events in the Middle East.\r\n\"We cannot and do not discount the possibility that Hamas or other foreign terrorist organizations could exploit the conflict to call on their supporters to conduct attacks on our own soil,\" FBI Director Chris Wray, told reporters.\r\n\"We are also particularly alert to the potential these events have to inspire violence against Jewish Americans or Muslim Americans, institutions and houses of worship.\"\r\nA six-year-old Muslim boy was stabbed to death in Illinois on Saturday in what has been described as a hate crime.\r\nStanford University in California was chosen as the venue for this unprecedented first public meeting of the Five Eyes because it lies in the heart of Silicon Valley and the security chiefs are issuing a public warning about China stealing innovation.\r\nBut in private meetings together, the Middle East will be high on the agenda.\r\n\"As you'd expect, we will also use our time together to discuss a range of other issues in private, including what Hamas's attack means both in the region and in our homelands,\" McCallum said.\r\nThe MI5 head told the BBC that one of the most difficult aspects of the role was to balance resources against different types of threats which were equally concerning.\r\n\"How do you balance the ability to track a teenage would-be terrorist consuming extreme right-wing and hateful material in his bedroom and potentially considering buying a bladed weapon with the longer-term risks posed by fast or precious cutting-edge research from one of our universities?

        "article": "Is there a possibility of peace between Israel and the Palestinians?\r\n\r\nThe path to peace is long and it is inevitable that it will cross the difficult path of self-criticism.\r\n\r\nSince its inception, Zionism has undoubtedly been one of the most controversial political movements. It is also one of the deadliest ideologies. However, it is considered marginal in terms of the number of advocates.  Yet, as regards the writings, articles and books published, Zionism occupies a dominant position in the media, academia, and international politics. It is undeniable that this is an important subject in the fields of political science, history, and social sciences.\r\nZionism is at the origin of one of the most unlikely political actions in history, where individuals of a people or community decide it is time to return to their land they left two thousand years ago.\r\nZionism causes irritation, misunderstanding, offense, and even outrage, in addition to causing death. Some are embarrassed by its arrogance and high-handed behavior, as well as the violence of some of its discourses and inhumane actions. It is also strange because it often presents itself as a winner on one side and a victim on the other. \r\nIn its latest report on the Israeli-Palestinian situation, the NGO Human Rights Watch, states that the Jewish state now corresponds to an apartheid state, based on the definition of differential treatment of citizens according to their ethnic or religious origin.\r\nThere is no simple solution to this conflict, but refusing to recognize the legitimacy of each can only prevent peace from being achieved. This drama is not limited to the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, which are those that occur between the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza and the Israelis, nor to the Israeli-Arab conflicts, which are those that occur between Israel and its more or less distant neighbors, such as Iran. It also includes conflicts between Jews and Palestinians in the State of Israel.  On both sides, many Israeli citizens are not Zionists. The situation is extremely complex. \r\nThis tragedy is shared by both Israelis and Palestinians. The path to peace is long and it is inevitable that it will cross the difficult path of self-criticism. \r\nAs a reminder, here are some causes of the upsurge of violence in the region: 1) In Syria, we witness the annexation by Israel of the Golan Heights since the Six Day War in 1967; repeated violations of Syria's airspace and maritime space.  2) In Lebanon, we see Israel’s continued occupation of the Chabha farms in southern Lebanon; its military support for the Christian militias in southern Lebanon, created with Israel’s help, and its desire to disarm the Hezbollah militias; frequent violations of Lebanese airspace and sea. 3) In Palestine, Israeli forces refuse to withdraw from the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, despite United Nations resolutions; expropriations of Palestinian lands and construction of settlements in the Negev desert and the occupied West Bank; imprisonment of about five thousand Palestinians, including children; land and sea blockade imposed on Gaza despite Israel’s “withdrawal” from that territory; blackmail about tax money collected by Israel and owed to the Palestinian Authority; desire to annex the Al-Aqsa Mosque to Jerusalem (in fact all of East Jerusalem to make this multi-faith city the capital of Israel), under the pretext that it was built on an old Jewish temple; discrimination in the distribution of drinking and irrigation water ; daily vexations and abuses, etc.\r\nToday, there is so much to tell about the human tragedy that has struck the Palestinian people since their land was colonized by Israel. By appropriating eight-tenths of Palestinian territory since its creation in 1948, Israel ended Palestinian nationality and dealt a severe blow to the identity of this people. Those who remained in the part of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel became Israelis. But second-class Israelis, discriminated on the basis of their faith and identity and reduced according to their status as colonized people.\r\nTwo-thirds of Gazans live in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip and whose families were expelled from their towns or villages in 1948 during the attacks of the Zionist pioneers. They have remained refugees in their own land for generations since that year.\r\nIn addition, following an intense battle for power in the Gaza Strip between Hamas, an Islamist party, and Fatah, the party of Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbass, Hamas won the parliamentary elections on January 25, 2006 to choose a new Palestinian Legislative Council. Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip after its victory. It should be noted that the majority of women voted for Hamas. Fatah left the Gaza Strip and has now only control over the West Bank, if that can be considered control when one is under Zionist occupation. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbass, actually has very limited authority.\r\nThe election observation mission mandated by the European Union openly stated that the parliamentary elections were conducted in full transparency and regularity. However, the European Union does not recognize the results that led to the victory of Hamas, which it has since considered a terrorist group. While proclaiming the victory of Hamas, Israel, which had founded and funded the Hamas movement in order to discredit Fatah, worked hard to sabotage the elections. \r\nSince Hamas won the Gaza Strip in June 2007, there has been a struggle between this party and Fatah that has led to tensions between them. Israeli leaders are particularly determined to suffocate the Gazan population, a policy supported by Western countries that do not recognize the authority of Hamas.\r\nSince Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 and Egypt closed its Rafah border crossing, Israel has imposed a blockade that has hampered the social and economic life of Gazans. The bill is still in force in 2023, 17 years later. The UN estimates that Israel’s blockade of Gaza cost nearly $17 billion.\r\nIsrael restricts maritime access to Gaza and prohibits shipping. The city is also prevented from building port facilities. At the risk of being killed by Israeli border guards, the fishermen cannot fish offshore and must content themselves with navigating the area near the coast.\r\nPalestinians are prohibited from travelling between Gaza and the West Bank. As a result, families cannot visit each other.  Since 2008, Israel has carried out massive bombings on Gaza. The current war demonstrates the devastating impact of relentless bombing and heavy artillery fire on the civilian population. In 48 days of conflict, about 15,000 Palestinian civilians have lost their lives, including at least six thousand children, and the human toll is expected to rise. More than one million Gazans are displaced or injured and thousands of homes are destroyed. This nightmarish scenario takes place in Gaza and the West Bank where localities like Nablus, Jenin, Khan Younes, Rafah, Bayt Hanoun, and others are attacked by explosive weapons.\r\nAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the crisis is expected to affect two million people who need urgent humanitarian assistance. Reports continue to report civilians trapped in bombed areas. Severe shortages of essential health supplies, fuel and cash are reported in the Palestinian territory, with increased insecurity affecting access to basic services.  The Bureau is particularly concerned about the situation of persons with disabilities, the elderly or vulnerable, who face considerable difficulties in meeting their basic needs, such as finding shelter and accessing food. They are trapped and left behind. They need accessible information, safe evacuation routes, shelters and vital medical supplies.\r\nThe international community is deeply concerned about the significant loss of life and civilian damage caused by the use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas, but also by internationally prohibited weapons such as cluster munitions. \r\nShelling and artillery fire in Palestinian cities also caused damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals, schools, water systems, electricity and sanitation infrastructure and communication networks, disrupting access to essential services. Explosive remnants of war will contaminate the land and affect communities long after the war ends.\r\nWe call for a permanent ceasefire and respect for international law, including unfettered access to humanitarian aid. Ending military intervention is critical to protecting civilian lives. \r\nThe international community must do everything in its power to prevent this from happening again. The events in Palestine demonstrate the urgency of adopting the political declaration against the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. \r\nThe extermination of Gazans carried out by the Zionist state that has claimed thousands of victims is a real genocide in the literal sense of the term. The health crisis adds to the humanitarian crisis. The impact of the invasion on women and children is catastrophic.\r\nIn international law, genocide has been recognized since 1948 by the United Nations convention, which lists a series of crimes, including murder committed “with the intent of destroying, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.”\r\nIs there a possibility of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, or should we simply get used to periodic wars that deprive both sides of the peace and stability they seek? To renounce diplomacy is to accept the unacceptable: endless wars.\r\nThe history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is littered with failed peace plans, collapsed diplomatic conferences and disillusioned mediators. Yet even amidst the horrors of the Gaza war, calls for a possible two-state solution remain alive and are increasingly being heard.\r\nThe withdrawal of military and civilian colonial forces from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is the sine qua non condition for establishing peace, offering an opportunity for the Palestinian people to finally found an independent and sovereign Palestinian state.  \r\nThere is only one way to go in Gaza: the two-state solution. It seems feasible from a geographical point of view, provided that a compromise is found on the territories to be exchanged.\r\nThe main barrier to two-state resolution is political. The cessation of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations after the creation of a Palestinian national unity government integrating Hamas in the spring of 2014 shows that there is still a long way to go.\r\nThere is still a long way to go. Therefore, the idea of a Palestinian state was no longer on the Israeli political agenda or the international agenda. Even when former US President Donald Trump proposed the “deal of the century” in 2019, where he still referred to the hypothesis of such a state by conditioning it, conditionality was to accept a partial state, with no army and no independent airspace for a $50 billion mega economic development project. Instead, it turned its back on UN resolutions and ignored the nationalist aspirations of the Palestinians.  He announced Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the annexation of parts of the Jordan Valley to the occupied West Bank and the abolition of the right of return of the Palestinians. This deal was turned down by Fatah and Hamas.\r\nMoreover, the Arab regimes gave an incongruous place to the Palestinian cause in their foreign policy agendas for a long time. The current war is aggravating relations between the two warring parties and putting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back on the agenda.\r\nThe two-state theory is based on the idea that we face two nationalisms: Zionism and the Palestinian national liberation movement, each claiming a nation-state. The Oslo Accords, which were signed in 1993, are of historical importance because they formally set out this demand and perspective.\r\nSince the Oslo Accords have not been implemented and the settlements of the West Bank have continued to spread on the ground, the creation of a viable Palestinian state becomes de facto distant but more crucial than ever.\r\nNow that the humanitarian disaster in Gaza has brought the issue to the forefront, it is clear that there can be no resolution without some decisive steps towards a two-state solution despite the escalation of violence and even though the obstacles are enormous. Extremists on both sides want to control all the land between the river and the sea by any means necessary. If one or the other gains ground, this war will become even more deadly than it already is.\r\nThe optimal approach is therefore to adopt the renewed perspective of a two-state solution to rapidly galvanize the moderate forces of both parties. Such a conjecture will not apply without a strong and sustained international commitment from the United States, the European Union, Russia, and all Arab states.\r\nYet, after the horrors of this genocide, how could both sides choose to move closer rather than away? The European experience provides a significant lesson in this domain. New social movements and political coalitions must be created and sustained by the supporters of lasting peace. To create a new political entity, Europe has overcome two centuries of wars caused by deep divisions between ethnicities, religions, politics, and cultures. \r\nThe \"old continent\" became a new type of political entity less than a decade after the Second World War, with its religious and nationalist wars, its great power intrigues and the endless redistribution of national borders. It is now time for Israelis and Palestinians seeking peace to dare to envision an identical future for themselves. As the Chinese proverb says, “Peace and quiet is happiness”. If Europe could do it, the Middle East can.",

She did not clarify exactly what was modified and how, leading to several theories online, including one that has quickly gained traction amid concerns about her well-being.\nIn the snap shared by Kensington Palace, Kate sat in a chair surrounded by her three children — Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5.\n\"My analysis of the Kate Middleton photo saga is that they took her face from the Vogue cover she did years ago and edited it in,\" Ruby Naldrett, who works in social media at the Daily Mirror, posted via X, formerly Twitter, alongside a photo of the 2016 image.\nKate flashed a similar smile with her prominent dimples on the cover featuring \"Her Royal Highness, The Duchess of Cambridge\" at the time.\nThe post put the Mother's Day shot, which was said to have been captured during the March 10 holiday in the U.K., alongside the image taken eight years ago.\n\"Good find. Seems to be a step above a basic free trial photoshop,\" one person replied after seeing the photos juxtaposed, RadarOnline.com has learned. \"It's the sloppiness that surprises me. If true, this is amateur work. The Palace usually controls Kate's image so tightly, to risk backlash over a simple family photo seems like a huge miscalculation,\" a second commented.\nOthers, however, weren't convinced. \"Wait…are you saying a photo of Kate Middleton looks like another photo of Kate Middleton? I have no words to describe my shock at this revelation.\"\nSome of the photo faux pas that were noticed by eagle-eyed fans included Princess Charlotte's arm seeming to be missing, Kate's zipper appearing to be doctored, and the edges in various parts of the photo looking distorted.\nAnother theory taking over X is that Kate's new photo was from Nov. 2023 and the clothes were just altered to make it look fresh.\nMeanwhile, Kate was spotted leaving Windsor Castle today with Prince William after issuing an apology over the photo controversy.\n\"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused,\" she wrote via the official Prince and Princess of Wales account.\n\"I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.

May she rest in peace,\" Trump said, drawing laughter from the Rome crowd. \"She’s sort of making a career by pretending she likes me.\"\n\"They asked me that horrible, horrible question, remember?\" the ex-president said, recalling the SiriusXM radio host's opening question at the 2015 debate. \"And I said, 'Oh, am I dead?' That’s the first question I ever got.\"\nBack in 2015, Kelly began the debate by questioning Trump's past remarks about women.\n\"You’ve called women you don’t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,\" Kelly asked. \"Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?\"\nThe question didn't sit well with Trump and he launched a series of attacks aimed at her immediately after the debate.\nTrump branded the former news host a \"bimbo\" and claimed she \"had blood coming out of her eyes, or blood coming out of her wherever.\"\nWhile Kelly said at a Turning Point USA conference in July 2023 that her past differences with Trump were \"under the bridge\" and offered additional praise for him, the ex-president has been less forgiving.\nShortly after Trump's interview with Kelly, he blasted her at a campaign rally in Iowa.\n\"She became nastier all of a sudden,\" Trump said last year. \"She was pretty nasty, didn’t you think, anyone that watched it.\"\nTrump appeared upset at Kelly for asking about his handling of missing classified documents.\nKelly pressed the ex-president on his lawyers claiming all of the documents had been turned over, only for federal agents to find a treasure trove of boxes containing highly classified materials at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.",

Katie Britt, which Republican insiders say led to that members of her own party have “lost their minds.” .”\nOn Monday, it was Jon Stewart’s turn to throw some criticism at Britt for delivering an “objectively terrible” rebuttal to Biden’s speech. The Daily Show The host was admittedly shocked by Britt’s insistence to viewers that the Republican Party “sees you, we hear you and we stand with you.”\n“If you’re standing by my side, could you stand a little further away?” Stewart asked. He also imagined one of their children coming into the kitchen to grab a bowl of cereal in the midst of this menacing video and apologizing for not noticing, “You’ve lost your damn mind.” I’ll be back “When the Zannies intervene.”\nStewart is aware that Britt stole the show on Thursday night – and not in a good way. But he feels like an important part of their shitty reaction was largely overlooked; As Britt told all the listening parents and grandparents to “get into the arena,” he encouraged them to “never forget: We are steeped in the blood of the patriots who overthrew the most powerful empire in the world.”\n“Two things,” Stewart said. “Firstly, who smiles when it says: ‘Soaked in the blood of patriots’? And number two: This is just another entry in the Republican mythology that they are the heirs to the American revolutionary tradition. That they are somehow more American than non-Republican Americans.”\nStewart then showed clips of a number of Republicans declaring themselves “real” Americans and leaving the “real America.” The Daily Show The host asks himself, “What makes the Republican Party more American than the rest of us?” Sure, they bring up the Constitution a lot, but they also have a pretty liberal understanding of their words – like when Donald Trump says that it gives him the legal right to murder his political rivals in cold blood and face no consequences.\n“Do you remember ‘We the People’? You know there are more words after that, right?” Stewart wanted to know. Which ultimately led him to the problem with Republicans like Trump and Britt and the people who blindly support the nonsense that comes out of their mouths.\n“If you want to love Trump, love him,” Stewart said. “Go to the rallies, buy the sneakers. You want to give him absolute power? You want him to be the leader of everything? You want him to have the right of a king? You do it. But stop portraying it as patriotism. Because the one thing you can’t say is that Donald Trump is following the tradition of the Founding Fathers. He advocates for complete and total presidential immunity…that’s monarchy bullshit. And it is your right to support it. But just do me a favor for historical accuracy: next time you want to dress smart at the rallies, wear the right coats in the right color,” he concluded, showing an illustration of several redcoats.",

It gave him great joy to know that his music touched so many for decades and would be his lasting legacy.

She wrote, “Love is all that matters… faithful and forever.”\nCarmen first gained fame as the frontman of the pop band Raspberries before making a name for herself as a solo artist in the 1970s and 1980s. The Raspberries, best known for their biggest hit “Go All the Way”, entered the charts again in 2014 after the song was used in the first song Guardians of the Galaxy Soundtrack, a stark contrast to being banned by the BBC for being too sexually explicit upon its release in 1972.\nCarmen wrote or co-wrote most of the songs, and when the band split up in the mid-’70s, he soon became a successful solo artist in December 1975 with “All by Myself,” the first single from his debut album.

Carmen’s manager David Spero told Deadline: “I just heard the news that my long-time friend and former client Eric Carmen has passed away.

        "article": "Dev Patel’s John Wick-inspired debut has major flaws\n\nThat’s incredible Monkey man, Dev Patel’s raucous directorial debut, which had its world premiere at the SXSW Film Festival on March 11, almost disappeared from the screen. Not necessarily because it deserves to be there and not end up on a streaming platform, but because it’s impossible for a streaming executive to believe that Patel’s film would play best on a TV.\nThe film was originally acquired by Netflix, which acquired global distribution rights for the film back in 2021. But Jordan Peele, who had a keen taste and eye for visual spectacle in his own films, saw a bigger vision – specifically, dozens of feet bigger. Peele knew that Monkey man belonged to the big screen and bought the rights to produce it under his company Monkeypaw. How fitting!\nThank God Peele stepped in. Without him Monkey manThe isolated benefits would be much harder to deduce, especially on a smaller screen. While Patel certainly has a vision, his first film is wildly scattered and tonally unpredictable. Despite his initial suggestion from a John Wick-similar scope, Monkey man The film quickly flounders as Patel’s story attempts to balance the heaviness of his heart and the immensity of his affection for classic action films. This imbalance makes for a watch that is not just unsatisfactory but disappointing – especially given all the promise hidden within the seams.\nComparing Patel’s film to the established John Wick Franchise isn’t exactly undeserved, considering insiders at Netflix were already doing the same in 2021. There is some narrative overlap between these stories. Both are about men who courageously stand up to an underworld of deadly corruption. Both stars are sexy guys who want revenge for the death of a loved one. And both test how far a film can go through excellently choreographed action sequences alone.\nAs it turns out, it’s not far. Monkey Man’s High-flying fight scenes are the best parts of the film. They’re crafted with an undeniably intelligent sense of combat, and Patel’s fluid direction is particularly effective when he’s able to draw from the wealth of references that fill his extensive knowledge of action films. But the film sometimes feels too in love with its own influences, hoping that audiences will be so won over by the fast-paced clashes between heroes and villains that they’ll forget the film’s long-winded, overwrought plot.\nMonkey man is about a young man, played by Patel, who makes a living as an amateur fighter in the depths of the slums of India. Patel’s character wears a monkey mask, partly as a tribute to his late mother, who taught him the legend of Hanuman, an Indian demigod known for his loyalty and bravery. The story stuck with the man after he watched his mother suffer a gruesome death at the hands of a local police chief during a land dispute in which he and dozens of others were killed and displaced by the policies of the Sovereign Party of India.\nThis is clearly a revenge story, and Monkey man wastes no time in illustrating just how far Patel’s character will go to seek revenge. The scenes in which Patel establishes these lengths are initially compelling to watch, but later become the film’s main obstacle when the story relies far too heavily on the hackneyed, overwrought tentpoles of a hero’s journey. You can see what Patel is going for here: something that’s not just referential, but a direct homage to the classic action films he loved – which he made sure to shout out to the SXSW audience before the film began. But Monkey man suffers when it settles for being a divided sum of its parts rather than a film that puts them all together to create something much greater and truly unique.\nTo be fair, watching Patel’s character begin his journey is absolutely fascinating. The first half hour of the film is a genuinely delightful romp that just becomes dispiriting when it falters as Patel captures the backstory to his character’s anger. This origin is so painfully obvious that it’s really confusing when the film focuses on it so intensely for a long middle section. This fascinating first hour becomes irrelevant and the action is left out in favor of a self-discovery sequence that is almost completely useless to the overall story.\nWhat’s frustrating is this Monkey man The film clearly positions itself as a pure action film, but there are only two large, longer action sequences. The fights are dynamic and superbly choreographed, with some jaw-dropping moments that fit well in the cinema, but aren’t enough to hold the film back when it falters, which is far more common. And while Patel does his best to be the glue with a solid performance, not even his own conviction can buoy a film that doesn’t know how to tread water.\nFortunately, there is a big climax, which is that these dashed hopes come true Monkey man a really interesting film. It would be far less fascinating if it were a perfect first attempt. Instead, it’s a compelling study of Patel’s burgeoning talents, which are more than evident despite how often he was confounded during his debut. Although Monkey man is infuriating, Patel’s work shows heart, love and promise – something that can’t be said about many other action films. Monkey man finds novelty in its imperfections, and these blemishes suggest that Patel is just on his way to something truly special.",

Why should we digitally alter photos? Are you comparing us to what’s going on in the UK? Why does the monarch have anything to do with us? No, that’s nothing. That’s what we do here.”\nNewsweek reached out to Kensington Palace via email seeking comment.\nThe discussion is a blow to the UK’s global image after the Princess of Wales was forced to apologize when traces of editing were discovered in a photo Kensington Palace officially released to news outlets to mark Mother’s Day.\nThe image was first posted to William and Kate’s social media channels on March 10, before being distributed to photo agencies. It shows the princess surrounded by her three children. A statement at the time said: “The Princess of Wales is delighted to share a new photo to mark Mother’s Day. The photo was taken of the Prince in Windsor earlier this week.”\nThe image gained significance as it was the first official photo Kate released in over two months after she retreated from the public eye following abdominal surgery in January.\nWith Kensington Palace refusing to provide “running commentary” on her health, speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding Kate, her health and whereabouts have mounted in recent weeks. This was added to when social media users discovered traces of editing in the Mother’s Day photo.\nThese marks included visible masking on Princess Charlotte’s sleeve, a cut in the zipper of Kate’s coat and discrepancies on Prince Louis’ trousers.\nAs discussion surrounding the image grew, photo agencies including the Press Association and Getty Images sent “kill” notices to news outlets, asking them to stop using the portrait because it might violate their policies.\nJust over 24 hours after it was first published, on March 11, Kate apologized on social media in a rare, personally written apology for any “confusion” her amateur edit may have caused.\n“Like many amateur photographers, I occasionally experiment with editing,” she said. “I would like to apologize for the confusion caused by the family photo we shared yesterday. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day. C.”\nDespite the apology, the royals are now being urged to release an unedited version of the photo as speculation about Kate and her health continues to grow.",

Putin also stressed that Moscow never needed to resort to nuclear weapons in Ukraine until now, despite continuing tensions in the region.\n\"We must boost our destructive capabilities by increasing both the sheer quantity and potency of our weapons, as well as improving the effectiveness of our military forces and resources. This means tactical and army aviation, as well as strategic forces, specifically focusing on components suitable for armed conflicts. These include ground-based weapons such as high-precision tools, artillery, and armored vehicles. Without any exaggeration, progress in this area is being made by leaps and bounds,\" Putin said during the interview with Kiselev.\n“We know what it is like when American troops are on Russian soil. They are interventionists. This is exactly how we will treat it, even if they appear on Ukrainian territory,” the Russian foreign minister posted as a quote from the interview, adding “If US troops appear in Ukraine, Russia will treat them as interventionists, and the US understands this.”\nThe Russian president’s comments came after France’s President Emmanuel Macron said he \"could not rule out\" sending French troops to Ukraine, causing a stir in the international community.",

        "article": "Hamas apologists are facing consequences\n\n“We are fighting to save the whole world from the pestilence of Nazi tyranny and in defense of all that is most sacred to man,” Winston Churchill once declared.\nToday’s Nazis, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Wednesday, are Hamas — the barbarous terrorist group that has brutally slaughtered, kidnapped and raped nearly 1,600 innocent Israelis.\nLast weekend, Aurora City Council members Juan Marcano and Alison Coombs canceled their memberships in Denver’s chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) in opposition to the organization’s brazen defense of Hamas’ brutal acts of terrorism and war crimes. Was it genuine?\nOn Tuesday, I explained how DSA resignations were driven by political convenience during an election year — with Marcano running for mayor and Coombs seeking City Council at-large — given Denver DSA’s longstanding anti-Semitic views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For instance, back in 2017, they’d shared the phrase “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — which implies replacing Israel with a Palestinian state.\nAt Monday’s city council meeting, Marcano and Coombs confirmed these suspicions. When Councilwoman Francoise Bergan proposed a resolution heartily backing Israel and unequivocally condemning Hamas and anti-Semitism, Marcano and Coombs offered amendments to fundamentally change its intent — by trying to equate Israel with Hamas.\nEarlier that day, Coombs touted the Working Families Party, a radical alternative to DSA that tends to endorse identical candidates. “I stand with WFP in their push to save the lives of Palestinians in the face of Israeli war crimes and apartheid,” she tweeted.\nLet’s be real: Neither Marcano nor Coombs were being genuine — and they were clearly playing politics when they canceled their DSA memberships. Now, their politics have begun alienating loyal Democrats.\nLittleton Democrat Jane Ringer is a retired accountant who, until recently, served as the Arapahoe Democratic Party’s volunteer treasurer. A donor to candidates across the county, she’d originally assumed her views would largely align with both Marcano and Coombs and donated a total of $125 between the two.\nThis week, Ringer asked both Marcano and Coombs to send her money back. “As a Jew whose father fought in World War II, I find their positions to be appalling. I thought we already fought this battle, you know?” she told me. “I have zero tolerance for the obliteration of Israel. So, I’m voting with my wallet by asking for my money back.”\n“I am now in alignment with my values, and I feel much better having spoken up,” Ringer added. “This just cuts way too deep for me.”\nWhen a candidate you support abandons your core values, you can always “claw back” any donations. If enough join in, it could deplete campaign war chests.\n“There’s still three weeks left until election day, and people should know they can vote not just with their ballot but with their money,” Ringer said. “If you have already donated, and you’ve suddenly discovered that a candidate is way out of alignment with your values, you can request a refund of your donation and explain to them why you’re doing it.”\nA growing number of wealthy donors are similarly voting with their wallets at a much larger scale — objecting to the shocking failures of Ivy League universities to decisively condemn anti-Semitism and show support for Israel in its battle against Hamas.\nThe Huntsman Foundation, which has contributed tens of millions of dollars to the University of Pennsylvania, decided to “close its checkbook on all future giving” due to the university’s “silence in the face of reprehensible and historic Hamas evil against the people of Israel (when the only response should be outright condemnation).”\nOther notable billionaire donors like Ronald Lauder, Marc Rowan and David Magerman likewise threatened to cut their contributions to Penn.\nHarvard University also faces staggering donor dissatisfaction. Former Limited Brands CEO Les Wexner’s Wexner Foundation cut off funding after three decades over “the dismal failure of Harvard’s leadership to take a clear and unequivocal stand” against Hamas. Other wealthy donors and alumni publicly blasted Harvard’s shocking tolerance of anti-Semitism.\nThe presidents of both Harvard and Penn finally issued strongly-worded statements condemning Hamas and rejecting anti-Semitism — but it’s likely too little, too late.\nFor different reasons, as Newsweek reported Wednesday, at least 10 former donors to embattled Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert — who collectively contributed nearly $13,000 to her 2020 campaign — have instead donated $17,800 total to her opponent in the Republican primary, lawyer Jeff Hurd.\nHurd announced his campaign this August but already reportedly raised nearly half of Boebert’s $854,000 in the bank — which is itself only a third of the whopping $3 million that her Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch, raised from July to September.\nIf Boebert wins her primary, as remains likely, can she raise enough to compete with Frisch? When I was in Mesa County last weekend, Boebert supporters expressed concern that her numerous rhetorical excesses and personal faults might doom her campaign in what should be a breeze reelection for a Republican.\nReality is starting to intervene in our heated sociopolitical climate. People are finally reaching their limits — drawing lines and making their voices heard through their wallets.\nThe actions of our leaders and institutions have consequences.",

And we’re going to make sure that happens again, right?” Biden told local supporters and volunteers in Milwaukee — the same city where Trump and his party will hold the Republican National Convention in July.\nBiden has taken to repeatedly calling Trump a loser, knowing it rankles the defeated former president, who still refuses to acknowledge he lost four years ago.\nWisconsin and Michigan, which Biden will visit on Thursday, were among the crucial states he flipped from Trump in their 2020 showdown and needs to win again to secure a second term.\nBiden took on Trump over immigration, a key issue in the election with the Republican resorting to increasingly hardline rhetoric as he bashes the Democrat over record numbers of people crossing the border from Mexico into the United States.\n“We are a country of immigrants. They’re not vermin,” Biden said, referring to comments Trump made last year. Trump has also referred to immigrants “poisoning the blood of our country.”\nBiden also addressed the issue of marijuana reform, which he called a priority in his State of the Union speech last week and which Democrats identify as important as they seek crucial young and ethnic minority voters.\n\n– ‘Retribution’ –\nEarlier in Milwaukee, Biden unveiled over $3 billion in infrastructure investment to help “left behind” areas as he seeks to tout what he calls an “American comeback” for the economy.\nBiden embarked late last week on a tour of battlegrounds states, buoyed by the fiery and well-received State of the Union address in which he again took aim at Trump.\nThe attacks underscored how bitter the next eight months of US politics promise to be, with the country’s oldest ever pair of election candidates making no secret of the personal bitterness between them.\nBoth men lashed out at each other after their nomination wins on Tuesday.\nTrump called Biden the “Worst, Most Incompetent, Corrupt and Destructive President in the History of the United States.”\nBiden assailed Trump’s “campaign of resentment, revenge, and retribution” and branded him a threat to democracy.\nIf reelected, Trump has pledged to be a “dictator” for his first day in power, when he says he will shut the border, order oil drilling and release supporters jailed for the January 6, 2021 US Capitol attack.\nHe has also promised the biggest ever mass deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants.\nThe political divisions in Washington have meanwhile paralyzed US foreign policy, alarming allies around the world.\nTrump’s Republican allies in Congress are blocking Biden’s request for $60 billion in vital military aid for Ukraine to fight Russia’s invasion.\nTrump has said he will not give a “penny” in military aid to support Ukraine and has encouraged Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack NATO allies that don’t meet financial pledges.",

        "article": "Whistleblower Victimized by ‘Me Too’ Psyop?\n\nAlternative media personality Russell Brand has been demonetized by YouTube. Mainstream media wants to cancel him. Brand is being pummeled by media-hyped allegations of sexual misbehavior in the mid-2000s when he was a BBC presenter.\nBrand’s antagonists are mainstream media companies, not police and prosecutors. He has not been charged with any crime. Like E. Jean Carroll, who accused Donald Trump of raping her almost 30 years ago (she couldn’t remember what year it supposedly happened), the women who say they willingly got into intimate situations with Brand, then experienced some form of boorishness or assault, never complained to police.\nRather than being accused in a timely fashion, tried in a court of law, and judged by a jury of his peers, Brand is facing a grossly belated trial-by-media in which he is presumed guilty until proven innocent. His punishment—a besmirched reputation, loss of income, and career damage—arrived with the dubious accusations, and will likely prove irreversible.\nBrand’s encounter with the #MeToo inquisition (call it the #MeTooInquisition if you like hashtags) raises the question: Whatever happened to the presumption of innocence?\nThe United States of America has historically embraced the concept that accused people are considered innocent until proven guilty.\nThough we inherited that notion through English common law, it has since become quasi-universal. The presumption of innocence is now enshrined in more than 150 countries and is mandated by the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThen along came the #MeToo pandemic. A long list of women, along with a few homosexual men, began echoing each other’s complaints: “So-and-so molested me decades ago and I forgot to complain then, so now I’ll get revenge by whining about it on Twitter.”\nOn the plus side, #MeToo did help take down some creeps, like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein. The perception that powerful men have sometimes enjoyed impunity, and that victims who failed to complain in a timely fashion were simply being realistic about their chances in court, is not entirely specious.\nBut the real problem with powerful men enjoying impunity for their dastardly crimes goes way beyond cases of boorishness, molestation, and allegations of sexual assault. America’s real rulers systematically violate the law, often in almost unimaginably egregious, horrific, and disgusting ways, and are almost never called to account for it, much less prosecuted, sentenced, and punished.\nUniversity of California professor Peter Dale Scott describes such people as members of the Deep State, which he describes as “the politically active rich” who constitute an “overworld” that is as far above the law as the ordinary mafia’s “underworld” is below it.\nThese are the people who use the CIA to dominate the world’s narcotics trade. They steal U.S. nuclear weapons and give them to Israel. They kill politicians, journalists, and whistleblowers who stand in their way: JFK, RFK, JFK Jr., Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Paul Wellstone, Karen Silkwood, Danny Casolaro, and Gary Webb are just a few of their most notable victims.\nThey orchestrate false-flag terror outrages like the Lavon Affair, the USS Liberty incident, 9/11, 7/7, Charlie Hebdo, and so much more. They blackmail politicians and other leaders, including fellow Deep State members, using satanic and pedophile cults to compile film footage of targets committing unbelievably evil crimes against children, as demonstrated by author Nick Bryan’s shocking book The Franklin Scandal. And they systematically rape, pillage, and slaughter nations targeted for destruction: The body count for covert CIA and overt U.S. military interventions since World War II has been credibly estimated at around 60 million by scholars Noam Chomsky and Andre Vltchek in their important volume On Western Terrorism.\nAnd that is just the shortest of short lists of well-documented Deep State crimes. A comprehensive list, especially if it included the 99% of suspected crimes that are less well-documented, would fill volumes.\nMainstream media’s primary task is to cover up the crimes of the Deep State and promote the “public myth” of democracy and the rule of law. To that end, the media misuses the presumption of innocence. It insists that Allen Dulles, James Angleton, self-confessed JFK assassin Howard Hunt, and other CIA figures who killed the president must be presumed innocent because they were never convicted in court. The same assumption applies to other “conspiracy theories,” i.e., examples of Deep State impunity.\n#MeToo arrived conveniently in 2017, just as Americans were waking up and smelling the Deep State. Suddenly, instead of seeing through mass media misuse of the presumption of innocence and facing the reality of Deep State crimes, we were supposed to believe that the real problem was individual men who treat women boorishly. They—not the Deep State—are the ones who are “obviously guilty.”\nThe takeaway: media propagandists are welcome to molest women (or children) with Jimmy Saville-style impunity, while whistleblowers like Russell Brand are fair game for the #MeToo Psyop.",

        "article": "In UK, Strange Bedfellows Join Forces to Create Registry of ‘Offenders’\n\nIn a startling development directly related to the ongoing war on free speech in the Western world, a leading conservative commentator and alleged free speech advocate has teamed up with an anti-free speech organization dedicated to exposing, slandering, and harming dissidents in the West.\nThis group is dedicated to fighting “anti-Semitism” and “hate”—nebulous concepts defined by organized grievance groups to shut down criticism and debate on controversial topics—by publicly “doxxing” and targeting dissidents operating on social media.\nDouglas Murray, a prominent author and journalist based in the UK who has written extensively about the failures of multiculturalism and the threat of mass immigration to the West, announced on X (formerly Twitter) in mid-February that he would be speaking at the official launch party of The Emergency Coalition Against Hate (TECAH), an organization that seeks to unite “diverse ethnic and religious communities to collaboratively confront threats to democracy” and to push back against “both Islamic extremism and divisive woke/DEI ideologies,” according to its website.\nTECAH is sponsored and organized by Tafsik, a Canadian-based “grassroots humanitarian organization dedicated to combatting the alarming rise of anti-Semitism across the globe.”\nTafsik notes on its website that it was founded in response to “the horrifying genocide” that Islamic fighters led by Hamas launched against Israel on Oct. 7 last year. Tafsik is primarily concerned with stamping out any criticism of organized Jewish groups and Israel’s ethnic cleansing campaign being waged against the Christians and Muslims in historic Palestine. Tafsik is one of many organizations that have arisen in the aftermath of the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas whose main purpose is to target critics of Israel and the various pro-\nIsrael lobbies dominating Western governments and media.\nTafsik “is driven by the unwavering belief that every Jewish person deserves to live in a world free from discrimination, persecution, and hatred,” according to its website.\nMurray, who ironically serves as director of the UK-based Free Speech Union, which is described on its official website as “a non-partisan, mass membership public interest body that stands up for the speech rights of its members and campaigns for free speech more widely,” has long presented himself as a political dissident and champion of free and open debate. Unless, of course, the topic is organized Jewish political, economic, and cultural power in the West, or the subservient role Western governments play to Israel. Those topics are off limits and are considered “anti-Semitic” or even “hate speech.”\nTafsik is also responsible for creating the Datahub Against Violence, Intimidation, and Discrimination (DAVID), which aims to “revolutionize the fight against bigotry” by allowing supporters of Tafsik to submit reports on individuals, organizations, or businesses that have posted “anti-Semitic” or other “hateful” or “offensive” material on social media. DAVID would then use the report to maliciously target those being reported for thought crimes, including for potential loss of employment, educational opportunities, or even criminal prosecution.\nThe reports submitted to DAVID “will have hyper-visibility using a simple Google search, affecting the individual’s employment opportunities and reputation,” according to Tafsik. The truly Orwellian nature of this malicious endeavor is spelled out in plain language on its website.\n“DAVID employs facial recognition to identify bigots from photos or videos,” the website explains. “AI ‘spiders’ crawl social media platforms, detecting anti-Semitic content in posts, comments, and images,” and then use the information to target political adversaries.\nTafsik even proposed creating a “Hate Offenders List” similar to a sex offenders list for those convicted of “hate speech.” A “Hate Offenders List” would “streamline law enforcement efforts, imposing travel restrictions, limiting access to certain public places, and significantly impacting job opportunities to deter the wielders of hatred from positions of power,” the organization explained. Following significant public backlash, that jargon has since been deleted from its website.\nMany wonder why an ostensible “free speech champion” such as Murray would risk his reputation supporting the efforts of such an anti-free speech organization?",

        "article": "Demand Justice for Jan. 6 Political Prisoners\n\nNew House Speaker Mike Johnson struck a blow for liberty and justice when he finally authorized the release of all the tapes from the Jan. 6, 2021 “insurrection.” We were told by no less than President Joe Biden himself that this was the “worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.”\nThe FBI was unleashed by the Biden administration to hunt down hundreds of participants in this “insurrection” and lock them up in the gulag where they awaited trial in torturous conditions—many in solitary confinement.\nA Congressional Committee was set up under then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi to “get to the bottom” of the “Trump-led insurrection.” It did not include a single representative nominated by the opposition Republican Party, but rather two “Republicans”—Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger—who could be relied on by Pelosi and the Democrats to toe the line.\nIn short, the whole thing was an old-fashioned Soviet show trial, where the evidence was kept secret and the pre-determined verdict—guilty—was to be used to tighten the grip of the ruling regime and intimidate any further dissenters into silence. The message was clear: “speak out against the ‘perfection’ of the 2020 election and you may find yourself in the gulag along with the insurrectionists.”\nIt was terrifying and profoundly anti-American.\nAnd, as we finally can see for ourselves thanks to Speaker Johnson, it was a huge lie. The new video shows demonstrators shaking hands with police officers once they entered the Capitol Building. They were welcomed into the building by officers who even held the doors for them to enter! They had no way of knowing that they would soon be rounded up and locked away.\nDoes that mean no crimes were committed on Jan. 6, 2021? Not at all. The tapes already released were carefully chosen to single out examples of violence and other possible criminality. But the full release of the tapes demonstrates beyond a doubt that the endless propaganda that this was a coordinated attempt to overthrow the government was false.\nAnd as for that violence and mayhem on that day? How much of it was instigated by undercover FBI agents? New footage clearly shows officers outside the building firing on protestors with no warning. That must be why, in hearing after hearing, Biden administration officials like Attorney General Merrick Garland have refused to tell Congress the number of federal agents present and their roles in instigating violence.\nThe release of this evidence should immediately result in the release of all non-violent protestors awaiting trial or serving their sentences. Those in power responsible for promoting this lie should take their places in the jail cells.\nThis delayed justice will not help protesters like Matthew Perna, however. Though the new video release clearly shows him calmly walking inside the Capitol in the presence of unconcerned police officers, when Merrick Garland’s Department of “Justice” announced they would seek terrorism charges against him, Perna, in despair, decided to hang himself in his garage.\nYes, there was an insurrection of sorts. Those in power hated Donald Trump so much that they were willing to torture and even murder their fellow Americans to keep him from the presidency. Unless these people are brought to justice, we will have no Republic left to defend.",

        "article": "Replacing DHS Secretary Won’t Stop the Invasion\n\nOn Feb. 13, House Republicans voted to impeach the disgraced and discredited Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, one of the primary architects and enablers of the ongoing border crisis and migrant invasion of the U.S. that has rapidly spiraled out of control since President Joe Biden entered the White House.\nA previous attempt to impeach Mayorkas failed in early February, primarily because Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana was away from Congress while receiving cancer treatment.\nOnly three GOP representatives voted “no” in the successful impeachment resolution—Rep. Ken Buck (Colo.), Rep. Mike Gallager (Wisc.), and Rep. Tom McClintock (Calif.)—while 214 other GOP House members voted “yes.”\nBuck, Gallager, and McClintock also voted against the previous unsuccessful House attempt to impeach Mayorkas. They echoed arguments made by Biden and other Democrats that the impeachment attempt marks a politicization of the entire impeachment process and that a cabinet official should not be impeached due to disagreements with policy, ignoring the fact that Democrats have long politicized impeachment efforts against former President Donald Trump and Mayorkas’s DHS has openly refused to enforce existing immigration law.\nHouse Democrats voted “no” in unison, yet Republicans were able to overcome the three dissenting “no” votes in their party and H. Res. 863 was successfully passed, 214-213.\n“Proud of our Republican conference for working together to stand with the American people to hold Secretary Mayorkas accountable for his blatant violation of our border laws,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), one of the leading proponents of impeaching Mayorkas and a major critic of the Biden administration’s open borders policies, proclaimed on social media shortly after the vote.\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green (R-Tenn.) said that GOP House members have much more work to do before arguing that Mayorkas’s DHS “has sparked the worst border crisis in American history.”\n“It’s long past time for him to be impeached,” Green stated.\nThe text of the resolution argues that Mayorkas must be impeached due to his “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law” and “breach of public trust.” Mayorkas has laughably maintained that the U.S. border is in fact secure under his watch and that the migrant crisis has been manufactured, overhyped, and politicized by Republicans for partisan gain, seemingly oblivious to the facts and reality on the ground at the border and across the country.\n“Throughout his tenure as secretary of Homeland Security, Mayorkas has repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security,” the resolution states. “In large part because of his unlawful conduct, millions of aliens have illegally entered the U.S. on an annual basis with many unlawfully remaining” in the country.\nThe DHS under Mayorkas has systematically refused to comply with the law, which has “significantly contributed to unprecedented levels of illegal entrants, the increased control of the Southwest border by drug cartels, and the imposition of enormous costs on states and localities affected by the influx of aliens,” the resolution powerfully argues.\nFor his part, Biden described the resolution as a “political stunt” and said that “Republicans with genuine concerns about the border should want Congress to deliver more border resources and stronger border security.”\nMeanwhile, Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for DHS, said House Republicans trampled on “the Constitution for political gain” with the impeachment effort.\nWhile the facts laid out in the bill do indeed stand on a solid basis, many skeptics view the impeachment effort as political theater and a publicity stunt for Republicans in an election year. Political analysts say that the impeachment of Mayorkas is extremely unlikely.\nFollowing the successful House resolution, the impeachment will now go to the Senate, where an impeachment trial will take place. A successful conviction would require a two-thirds majority vote, an unlikely scenario considering Democrats control the upper chamber of Congress. Republicans in the Senate would need over a dozen Democrats to vote for impeachment in order for Mayorkas to be removed from office.\nA day before the House vote, CBS News reported that 64.3 million requests were made by desperate, opportunistic migrants to enter the U.S. using CBP One, a smartphone app touted by the Biden administration to help initiate and facilitate the asylum process, which is riddled with serious problems and irregularities immigration hawks maintain.\nRelying on internal government documents, CBS News demonstrated just how serious the border crisis is: nearly 450,000 migrants have been granted entry into the U.S. based on this process alone over the past year, never mind the millions crossing illegally or directly processed and released by immigration officials.\n“It’s a staggering number,” Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told CBN News. “There’s a lot of people who would love to migrate to the United States. In essence, they see CBP One as sort of a self-petitioning mechanism that we’ve never had before.”\nThe Biden White House has done everything in its power to open America’s borders and facilitate the migrant invasion, the majority of whom often go on to receive and exploit public resources while average Americans continue to suffer and billions of dollars are sent overseas to finance needless and immoral wars. Major cities across the nation, including New York City and Chicago, for example, continue to struggle with the seemingly endless streams of destitute, largely uneducated and unskilled migrants flooding into major metropolitan areas.\nMayorkas and his supporters claim the impeachment effort against him is driven by “conspiracy theories,” such as the Great Replacement, which posits that America and other Western countries are being flooded with Third World migrants against the wishes or input of the public in an effort to entirely transform the traditional demographics and culture of the West. The simple fact of the matter is the Great Replacement is objectively happening and is epitomized by the Biden administration’s immigration policies, particularly with Mayorkas at the head of the DHS.\nIn a Senate hearing late last year, Mayorkas invoked his family’s experience during the Holocaust of WWII to shut down criticism of his tenure as chief of the DHS, which is responsible for protecting America’s borders and enforcing immigration laws.\nWhile the Republican-led impeachment effort is notable for its honest assessment of the full-blown treason and dereliction of duty on vivid display with Mayorkas as head of the DHS, it appears this charade is being put on for political theater as the 2024 election approaches. It will take much more than the impeachment of Mayorkas to fully tackle the border crisis and migrant invasion taking place in the United States.\nAfter all, the Democrats have dozens of people just like Mayorkas waiting in the wings who will champion the same policies he has.",

        "article": "NO FRIEND: Schumer Calls for New Elections in Israel, Says Netanyahu Obstacle to Peace\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is calling on Israel to hold new elections, saying he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has “lost his way” in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and a growing humanitarian crisis there.Join our WhatsApp group\nSchumer, the first Jewish majority leader in the Senate and the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S., will strongly criticize Netanyahu in a lengthy speech Thursday morning on the Senate floor. In prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press, Schumer says the prime minister has put himself in a coalition of far-right extremists and “as a result, he has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza, which is pushing support for Israel worldwide to historic lows.”\n“Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah,” Schumer will say.\nThe speech comes as an increasing number of Democrats have pushed back against Israel and as President Joe Biden has stepped up public pressure on Netanyahu’s government, warning that he needs to pay more attention to the civilian death toll in Gaza. The U.S. this month began airdrops of badly needed humanitarian aid and announced it will establish a temporary pier to get more assistance into Gaza via sea.\nSchumer has so far positioned himself as a strong ally of the Israeli government, visiting the country just days after the brutal Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and giving a lengthy speech on the Senate floor in December decrying ”brazen and widespread antisemitism the likes of which we haven’t seen in generations in this country, if ever.”\nBut he will say on the Senate floor Thursday that the ”Israeli people are being stifled right now by a governing vision that is stuck in the past.”\nSchumer says Netanyahu, who has long opposed Palestinian statehood, is one of several obstacles in the way of the two-state solution pushed by the United States. He is also blaming right-wing Israelis, Hamas and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\nUntil they are all removed from the equation, he says, “there will never be peace in Israel and Gaza and the West Bank.”\nSchumer says the United States cannot dictate the outcome of an election in Israel, but “a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel, at a time when so many Israelis have lost their confidence in the vision and direction of their government.”\nIt is unclear how Schumer’s unusually direct call will be received in Israel. The next parliamentary elections are expected in 2026 but could be held before then.\nMany Israelis hold Netanyahu responsible for failing to stop the Oct. 7 cross-border raid by Hamas, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and his popularity appears to have taken a hit as a result.\nU.S. priorities in the region have increasingly been hampered by Netanyahu’s Cabinet, which is dominated by ultranationalists. The far-right Cabinet members share Netanyahu’s opposition to Palestinian statehood and other aims that successive U.S. administrations have seen as essential to resolving Palestinian-Israeli conflicts long-term.\nIn a hot-mic moment while speaking to lawmakers after his State of the Union address, Biden promised a “come to Jesus” moment with Netanyahu.\nAnd Vice President Kamala Harris, Schumer and other lawmakers met last week in Washington with Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s War Cabinet and a far more popular rival of Netanyahu — a visit that drew a rebuke from the Israeli prime minister.\nGantz joined Netanyahu’s government in the War Cabinet soon after the Hamas attacks. But Gantz is expected to leave the government once the heaviest fighting subsides, signaling the period of national unity has ended. A return to mass demonstrations could ramp up pressure on Netanyahu’s deeply unpopular coalition to hold early elections.\nSchumer said that if Israel tightens its control over Gaza and the West Bank and creates a “de facto single state,” then there should be no reasonable expectation that Hamas and their allies will lay down arms. It could mean constant war, he said.\n“As a democracy, Israel has the right to choose its own leaders, and we should let the chips fall where they may,” Schumer said. “But the important thing is that Israelis are given a choice.”",

        "article": "To stay or go? Bombarded by Israel, Gazans make anguished choice.\n\nShould I stay or should I go? Can I find a way out? Is anywhere safe?\nAs the Israeli military continued its bombardment of the Gaza Strip Friday and gave 1.1 million Gazans a 24-hour ultimatum to evacuate to the southern end of the besieged coastal enclave, these frantic questions consumed Gazans, with no clear answers – and life-or-death consequences.\nIn Gaza City, a sleepless night of bombardment and rumors gave way to a morning of frantic second-guessing and scrambling for transport as Israel called on Palestinians to vacate to south of Wadi Gaza, a dividing waterline in the center of the strip.\nHamas told Gazans to stay put, and the United Nations requested that Israel rescind the decision, which would create the largest single forced displacement the Middle East has seen in decades, calling it both “impossible” and “devastating.”\nBut those who could Friday packed into cars with little more than the clothes on their backs and drove out of Gaza City.\nA steady stream of vehicles along the coastal road leading south from Gaza City midday became an afternoon traffic jam.\n“People are packed in the streets, even evacuating on donkey carts,” says Sara al-Saqqa, a surgeon at Al Shifa Hospital. The facility had been one of the lone refuges in the city, and had hosted thousands seeking shelter from airstrikes amid the weeklong bombardment campaign that followed Hamas’ attack on Israel last Saturday.\n“Everyone is fleeing. I saw people evacuating; I could not even enter the hospital,” Dr. Saqqa says.\nYet still tens of thousands remained in Gaza City, without cars, fuel, or a destination or acquaintance to stay with in southern Gaza.\nIn response to the Hamas assault, which killed 1,300 Israelis, mostly civilians, Israel mounted a massive and relentless bombing campaign that had killed 1,799 Gazans as of Friday, leaving no neighborhood untouched and sparking a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions.\nAs of late Thursday, before the Israeli ultimatum, 423,378 people had already been displaced by the six days of conflict in the 140-square-mile strip, the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday.\nOn Friday, Gaza City residents received airdropped flyers in Arabic purporting to be from the Israeli army with a map of Gaza and an arrow pointing south, warning, “Gaza City has become a battlefield. You are to evacuate your home immediately and head to the south of Wadi Gaza.”\n“Terrorist organizations have launched a war against the state of Israel,” the flyer said, a copy of which was provided to the Monitor. “For your safety and security, do not return to your homes until further notice from the Israel Defence Forces.”\nHamas, the militant group that controls the strip, urged otherwise.\n“We tell the people of northern Gaza and from Gaza City, stay put in your homes, and your places,” Eyad al-Bozom, spokesperson for the Hamas Interior Ministry, was quoted by Reuters as saying in a press conference at Al Shifa early Friday.\n“By carrying out massacres against the civilians, the occupation wants to displace us once again from our land,” he said, dismissing the warnings as a “disgusting psychological war.”\nThe shortages of electricity and fuel, as well as disruptions to the communications network, began to affect Palestinians across the territory, with most Gazans plunged into darkness Thursday evening, without electricity for mobile phones. Israel said the cutoffs were intended to isolate an enemy that was still firing rockets into Israel, yet they were also preventing Gazans from receiving information or reaching what was supposed to be safer territory.\n\nHind Khoudary escapes with her family\nAfter my third sleepless night on a hospital floor at Al Shifa, I had to make the decision: Do I stay in Gaza City or go south? Do I go with my mother to Rafah, or to Deir al-Balah with my husband, to what was supposed to be relative safety?\nAt 10:41 a.m., my husband and I, my in-laws, my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and their daughter, Loli, piled into the car to stay with family friends in the village of Deir al-Balah, 7 miles south of Wadi Gaza.\nWith only minutes to spare before our planned departure, I grabbed my laptop, phone chargers, my ID, and a bag my mother packed for me.\nI stopped by a pharmacy for treatment for an infection from a deep cut in my leg; all they could give me was some gauze.\n“We barely have medical supplies; four rolls of gauze is enough,” the pharmacist tells me.\nIn Gaza City, many gas stations were shuttered. I saw several people begging station managers for fuel.\nMy husband found one of the last gas stations still open, but the attendant could only provide us with 50 shekels’ ($12.57) worth of fuel – about 8 liters (2.1 gallons) – as part of a rationing cap to distribute fuel to as many people as possible.\nYet many people we know do not even have cars; cars have burned in the missile strikes. Others simply do not know anyone in southern Gaza to stay with. Others still prefer to stay rather than be internally displaced.\nMy aunt told me she would prefer dying at home, surrounded by her children and grandchildren, than evacuating. This is why thousands are staying put in Gaza City, despite the danger.\nAneel, one of many frantically trying to find a way out, was stranded in Tal al-Hawa, a neighborhood in southern Gaza City. She had been evacuated from her home in Shuja’iyya, east of the city center, after a missile strike earlier this week.\n“We can’t find a car to take us to the south; there are no cars and there is no one to take us,” she told my mother in an urgent phone call.\nThe coastal road leading out from Gaza City to the south, the road farthest from the barrier wall, was covered in dust and cracked from missile strikes. Because we left early, we made it to Deir al-Balah in 10 minutes. But now there are lines of cars to get out of Gaza City.\nAlthough Israel told us Deir al-Balah would be safe, within hours of our arrival a house was struck near us. Hours after we made the journey, three cars carrying families heading south reportedly were struck by Israeli missiles in Wadi Gaza.\nI wished I had had the time to grab my favorite blanket from home, and say one last goodbye to my family house, in case it is bombed before I can return.\n\nHealth care battle\nThe U.N. and international humanitarian organizations warned it was impossible to evacuate vulnerable and elderly Gazans and hospital patients from northern Gaza, many of whom rely on life support and mechanical ventilators.\n“There are severely ill people whose injuries mean their only chances of survival is being on life support,” said World Health Organization spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. “Moving these people is a death sentence. Asking health workers to do so is beyond cruel.”\nThe order to evacuate has proved yet another crisis for local health care workers in Gaza facing an uphill battle.\nPalestine Red Crescent Society spokesperson Nebal Farsakh described the situation as “catastrophic,” with hospitals overflowing with patients, medical supplies dwindling, electricity shortages widespread, and health centers flooded with citizens seeking shelter. Paramedics brave airstrikes, and several have been killed in the weeklong conflict.\nOver the past week, hospitals have emerged as makeshift shelters as thousands of Palestinian civilians flocked to hospitals in northern Gaza such as Al Shifa and Al Quds, out of the belief that the health centers are now the only safe areas Israel will not strike.\nWith Israel’s ultimatum Friday, it is unclear whether those safe havens will remain.\nYet despite the challenges and the Israeli ultimatum, the Palestine Red Crescent Society says their health care workers will not “turn their backs” on Gaza City and abdicate their responsibility.\n“The decision has been made: We are not evacuating. We are not turning back on our duty. We will stay in our main office in Gaza,” Ms. Farsakh says.\n“We cannot evacuate the patients; most of them are not in condition for transfer right now. Al Quds hospital is crowded with displaced civilians, our team, and relocated paramedics,” she adds.\nMedhat Abbas, director general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, declared a “collapse” of Gaza’s health system, with overflowing hospitals struggling to treat injured civilians and unable to evacuate them.\n“The health sector completely collapsed,” Dr. Abbas says in a phone call from Gaza City cut short by communications disruptions. “People are sleeping on the ground in hospitals, which are overflowing with displaced civilians next to bodies and the injured.”\n",

        "article": "Hebrew University Suspends Professor Who Denied Oct. 7th, Accused Israel Of Genocide\n\nIn the wake of sharp public criticism of a Hebrew University professor who has made incendiary statements against Israel and accused it of genocide in Gaza, the university has decided to suspend the professor from academic activity.\nThe law faculty lecturer, Professor Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, has been making public statements against Israel since the outset of the current war and has also denied the horrors of October 7th, expressed opposition to Zionism and signed a petition accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.\nThe university had previously suggested that she consider leaving her position, but she remained and continued to voice her criticisms of Israel. The university stated that her remarks cynically take advantage of her academic freedom of expression “for incitement and to create division.”\nIn a recent television interview, Shalhoub-Kevorkian stated: “It’s time to cancel Zionism,” and expressed doubt about the reported rape incidents on October 7, suggesting that any lie would be used to further a narrative. “They started with babies, they continued with rape, and they will continue with a million other lies. We stopped believing them, I hope the world stops believing them,” she said.\nIn response to her statements, Knesset member Sharren Haskel wrote to the Education Ministry, the Council for Higher Education and the management of the Hebrew University, demanding clarifications and suggesting that the university consider dismissing Shalhoub-Kevorkian from her position. Following this, the professor was suspended.\nIn October, Hebrew University president, Professor Asher Cohen, suggested that it would be appropriate for her to consider leaving her position. “Accusing Israel of occupying Palestine for 75 years essentially tries to undermine the basis for the existence of the State of Israel. It is hard to exaggerate the severity and absurdity of this claim, which is not even supported by the UN,” he said in a statement.\n“Your terrible claim about the genocide that Israel is supposedly carrying out these days is not far from the crimes of incitement and rebellion – crimes that would allow us to bring you to disciplinary trial and demand your suspension or expulsion from the Hebrew University,” he added. “The military operation that Israel is currently conducting in order to destroy the murderous terrorist organization Hamas does not come close to the definition of genocide according to international law. On the other hand, the terrible massacre carried out by Hamas on October 7 against Jews because they are Jews falls entirely within this definition.”\nIn response to the controversy, the Hebrew University said in a statement that: “The Hebrew University vehemently rejects all her distorted statements. The Hebrew University is proud to be an Israeli, public, and Zionist institution. As in the past, the heads of the university reiterate their call for the professor to find another academic home that aligns with her positions at this stage, and in order to maintain a safe climate on campus for the benefit of our students the university has decided to suspend her from teaching.”",

The Israeli army blamed it on a misfired rocket attack by Hamas ally Islamic Jihad, which has described the accusations as \"lies\".\r\nHere are some of the major reactions:\r\n\r\nUN\r\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \"horrified by the killing of hundreds of Palestinian civilians in a strike on a hospital in Gaza\".\r\nGuterres \"strongly condemned\" the strike but without attributing responsibility.\r\n\r\nUnited States\r\nPresident Joe Biden said he was \"outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion\" and \"the terrible loss of life that resulted\".\r\nBiden said he had spoken to Jordan's King Abdullah II and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"immediately upon hearing this news.\"\r\n\r\nEgypt\r\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi condemned in the strongest terms \"the Israeli bombing\" of the Ahli hospital, which led to \"the deaths of hundreds of innocent victims\" among the Palestinian citizens in Gaza.\r\nHe called the \"deliberate bombing\" a \"clear violation of international law\".\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia\r\nRegional heavyweight Saudi Arabia condemned the hospital strike as \"a flagrant violation of all international laws and norms\", denouncing Israel's \"continuous attacks against civilians\".\r\n\r\nJordan\r\nIsrael bears \"responsibility for this grave incident,\" a Jordanian foreign ministry statement said, \"strongly condemning\" the incident.\r\nAmman subsequently announced the cancellation of a summit on brokering peace in the region due to involve US President Joe Biden, who postponed his trip to Amman in response.\r\nDozens of protesters attempted unsuccessfully to storm the Israeli embassy compound in Amman an AFP journalist said.\r\n\r\nEU\r\nEU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell deplored that \"once again, innocent civilians pay the highest price.\"\r\n\"The responsibility for this crime must be clearly established & the perpetrators held accountable,\" he wrote on X.\r\n\r\nIran\r\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi declared a day of \"public mourning\" on Wednesday and said the strike on the hospital would turn against Israel and its US ally.\r\n\"The flames of the US-Israeli bombs, dropped this evening on the Palestinian victims injured at the... hospital in Gaza, will soon consume the Zionists,\" Raisi said, according to the IRNA agency.\r\nHundreds of protesters gathered outside the British and French embassies in Tehran overnight. Several thousand gathered earlier in Palestine Square in central Tehran to voice their anger.\r\n\r\nIraq\r\nIraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani called in a statement for an \"immediate and urgent resolution\" from the UN Security Council to put an end to the \"aggression\".\r\nThe government has declared three days of mourning for the victims of the strike.\r\n\r\nTurkey\r\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the incident as \"the latest example of Israeli attacks devoid of the most basic human values\", in a message on social media.\r\n\"I invite all humanity to take action to stop this unprecedented brutality in Gaza,\" Erdogan said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\r\n\r\nFrance\r\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said \"nothing can justify targeting civilians\" after the deadly strike on the hospital.\r\n\"Humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip must be opened without delay,\" he added.\r\n\r\nHezbollah\r\nLebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement on Tuesday called for a \"day of rage\" to condemn a strike on a Gaza Strip hospital, blaming Israel for what it called a \"massacre\".\r\n\"Let tomorrow, Wednesday, be a day of rage against the enemy,\" Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, said in a statement, calling the strike a \"massacre\" and \"brutal crime\".\r\nHezbollah's call came as hundreds of demonstrators scuffled with Lebanese security forces outside the US embassy in the Beirut suburb of Awkar, where protesters chanted \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel.\"\r\n\r\nArab League\r\nArab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said \"the West must stop this tragedy immediately\".\r\n\"Our Arab mechanisms document war crimes, and their perpetrators will not be able to escape justice,\" he warned.\r\n\r\nAfrican Union\r\nThe African Union chief Moussa Faki Mahamat accused Israel of a \"war crime\" following the deadly strike.\r\n\"There are no words to fully express our condemnation of Israel's bombing of a #Gaza hospital today, killing hundreds of people,\" Faki said on X, formerly Twitter, calling for the international community to act.\r\n\r\nQatar\r\nQatar's foreign ministry called the strike \"a brutal massacre\" and \"a heinous crime against defenceless civilians\".\r\nIn a statement, the Gulf state called the attack on Ahli Arab Hospital a \"blatant violation of the provisions of international law\" and a \"dangerous escalation in the course of the confrontations\".\r\n\r\nTunisia\r\nHundreds of angry protesters gathered outside the French embassy in Tunisia on Tuesday, also denouncing the US, after the hospital strike.\r\n\"The French and Americans are allies of Zionists,\" demonstrators shouted, according to an AFP journalist.\r\nProtesters demanded the recall of both countries' ambassadors and shouted: \"No American embassy on Tunisian territory.\"\r\n\r\nWHO\r\nThe World Health Organization condemned the deadly strike and demanded the immediate protection of civilians and health care in the strip.\r\n\"WHO strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab Hospital,\" the UN health agency said in a statement.\r\n\"The hospital was operational, with patients, health- and care-givers, and internally-displaced people sheltering there.

That makes this the deadliest of the five Gaza wars for both sides.\r\nMore than 1,300 Israelis have been killed, the vast majority of them civilians killed in Hamas’ October 7 assault. This is the deadliest war for Israel since the 1973 conflict with Egypt and Syria.\r\nHospitals are expected to run out of generator fuel within two days, according to the UN, which said that that would endanger the lives of thousands of patients. Gaza’s sole power plant shut down for lack of fuel after Israel completely sealed off the 40-km-long (25-mile-long) territory following the Hamas attack.\r\nIn Nasser Hospital, in the southern town of Khan Younis, intensive care rooms are packed with wounded patients, most of them children under the age of 3. Hundreds of people with severe blast injuries have come to the hospital, where fuel is expected to run out by Monday, said Dr. Mohammad Qandeel, a consultant at the critical care complex.\r\nThere are 35 patients in the ICU who depend on ventilators to stay alive and another 60 on dialysis. If fuel runs out, “it means the whole health system will be shut down,” he said.\r\n“We are talking about another catastrophe, another war crime, a historical tragedy,” he said, as children moaned in pain in the background. “All these patients are in danger of death if the electricity is cut off.”\r\n\r\n7 newborns in ICU\r\nDr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of paediatrics at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, said it did not evacuate despite Israeli orders. There are seven newborns in the ICU hooked up to ventilators, he said. “We cannot evacuate, that would mean death for them and other patients under our care.”\r\nAnd wounded patients keep coming in with severed limbs, severe burns and other life-threatening injuries. “It’s frightening,” he said.\r\nA crowd of men, women and children that medical officials estimated at 35,000 crammed into the city’s main hospital, Shifa, hoping it would be spared in the coming attack.\r\nGaza was already in a humanitarian crisis due to a growing shortage of water and medical supplies caused by the Israeli siege. With some bakeries closing, residents said they were unable to buy bread. Israel has also cut off water, forcing many to rely on brackish wells.",

Blinken has stressed full US support for a forceful response to the deadly Hamas raid, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.\r\nBut he is also trying to mitigate the civilian casualties in Gaza, the enclave that is governed by the Palestinian militant group. Israel has already killed nearly 3,000 Palestinians in relentless airstrikes, and blocked food, water and electricity to Gaza, plunging it into a humanitarian crisis.\r\n\"Blinken is trying to thread the needle,\" says David Schenker, the state department's former top diplomat for the Middle East. \"So far, he seems to have managed it relatively well. But it becomes more and more challenging.\"\r\nBlinken's emphasis on protecting civilians grew during his whirlwind tour of America's Arab allies at the end of last week, visiting six countries in three days.\r\nHe wanted them to clearly condemn Hamas for the unprecedented scale and brutality of the attack, and hoped to limit criticism of Israel's military campaign.\r\nA lengthy Israeli ground operation could inflame their populations, who support the Palestinian cause, threatening stability in their countries and narrowing the diplomatic room that Arab heavyweights such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia have to calm the situation.",

Be'eri lies just five kilometres from the Gaza border and was one of the early sites targeted by Hamas on Saturday morning. More than 100 bodies were found.\r\nShira was initially able to exchange messages with her family as they hid in a shelter while Hamas terrorists raided the kibbutz, but then contact was lost.\r\n\"Many hours passed by, and the silence became louder and louder. And it still does since Saturday morning,\" Shira told a solemn crowd in front of the European Parliament.\r\nHer uncle's telephone was later located in the Gaza strip.\r\nAlso at the rally was Jonathan Guttman, 31, a medical graduate who lives in Prague. His cousin Evyatar, 23, was celebrating the Jewish festival of Sukkot at the Supernova festival in southern Israel when Hamas militants stormed in, killing an estimated 260 people.\r\nHis family believes Evyatar is among the hostages after videos have emerged showing him held by Hamas militants handcuffed with cable ties, and being walked into the Gaza strip. The Israeli Defence Forces have also stated they believe Evyatar has been abducted.\r\nBoth Shira and Jonathan pleaded with EU leaders to do use their political clout to ensure the return of their loved ones home.\r\n\"My message is, do everything in your power to get these people out. You know it's the right thing, a human thing to do. These are the values of the European Union: equality, human rights,\" Jonathan said.\r\n\"Please help us get them out,\" Shira pleaded, \"please put the pressure on the right people, on global leaders, on anyone that can help our government set them free.\"\r\nDan Sobovitz, one of the organisers of the rally who sits on the Board of Directors of the Brussels-based Secular Jewish Community Center (CCLJ), told Euronews the relatives had a productive meeting with EU leaders, including European Council President Charles Michel, earlier on Wednesday.\r\n\"This is not only the responsibility of the Israeli government, this is also the responsibility of EU governments because there are EU citizens among the hostages, because it's a humanitarian crisis, and because any civilized person should be appalled by the idea of a baby being held hostage by terrorists,\" Sobovitz said.\r\n\"They (the hostages) should not be players in a political game. They should not be a way to justify whatever Israel will do or Hamas will do. They need to be released,\" he added.\r\nFive days after Hamas' assault, the fate of the hostages remains unclear, and locating and reaching them in Gaza is proving difficult. EU leaders have repeatedly called for their safe return.\r\nIsrael’s influential far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has called on the Israeli army to \"hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration,\" sparking condemnation among many Israelis concerned about abducted family members.\r\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Israeli ambassador to the EU told Euronews that Hamas was using hostages and innocent Palestinian civilians as a \"human shield\" in Gaza.\r\nCrowds also gathered in Brussels on Wednesday in solidarity with the Palestinian people, who have suffered devastating losses in the Israeli counter-offensive since Saturday, with at least 1,000 Palestinians killed.",

But this year, two groups had more candidates than available seats.\r\nIn Latin America, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Peru were vying for three seats, and in Eastern Europe, Albania, Bulgaria and Russia sought two seats.\r\nThe vote takes place by secret ballot, testing Russia's contention that it has private support in developing countries weary of the West's billions of dollars in support to Ukraine.\r\nIn April 2022, 93 countries voted to suspend Russia from the council, while 24 opposed that punishment.\r\nThat vote against Russia was less lopsided than other resolutions defending the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which drew approval from around 140 countries.\r\nVotes for the Human Rights Council are more complicated as some countries whose own records face scrutiny are uneasy about authorizing repercussions.\r\n\r\n'Undermine credibility'\r\nThe United States has often criticized the Human Rights Council over its membership and alleged slant against Israel, although President Joe Biden rejoined the group after a pullout by his predecessor Donald Trump.\r\n\"Russia's reelection to that body, while it openly continues to commit war crimes and other atrocities, would be an ugly stain that would undermine the credibility of the institution and the United Nations,\" senior US diplomat Robert Wood said.\r\nBut Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, insisted that there \"are no beacons of democracy or rogue states, as is sometimes being portrayed.\"\r\n\"No member-state can claim to be immune from human rights violations. But the solution is to strengthen international regulation,\" he said.\r\nHuman Rights Watch had called on countries to oppose the candidacies of Russia, China and Cuba.\r\nThe international advocacy group's Louis Charbonneau said after the vote that \"UN member states sent a strong signal to Russia's leadership that a government responsible for countless war crimes and crimes against humanity doesn't belong on the Human Rights Council.\"\r\nChina was ultimately reelected with 154 votes while Cuba also retained its seat with 146 votes.\r\nChina faced little risk as it was one of the four countries in the Asian group vying for four open seats, alongside Japan, Indonesia and Kuwait.\r\nThe United States and several other Western governments say China is committing genocide against its mostly Muslim Uyghur minority through massive camps, a charge denied by Beijing.",

        "article": "Israel-Gaza crisis dominates close of Human Rights Council session\r\n\r\nAt the concluding segment of the 54th Session of the UN Human Rights Council on Friday in Geneva, several States seized the opportunity to address the conflict engulfing Gaza and Israel, now in its sixth day.\r\nSome 22 countries and one non-governmental organization (NGO) took the floor, turning the meeting into a mini urgent debate on the crisis sparked by Hamas attacks against Israel and the capture of more than 100 Israelis who are being held hostage by militants inside the Gaza Strip.\r\nThe surprise incursion prompted intense aerial bombardment by Israel, a complete siege of the Gaza Strip, and an order to evacuate the northern part of the enclave within 24 hours, which began on Thursday evening, local time.\r\nAt the Council, Western States focused on condemning Hamas and support for Israel’s right to self-defense.\r\nStates that are part of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab Group focused on Israel’s attacks against Gaza while expressing support for the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination.\r\nThe UN’s preeminent human rights body is made up of 47 Member States who serve for a period of three years. Membership is based on equitable geographical distribution by region.\r\nAmong members that spoke were Pakistan (on behalf of the OIC), Algeria and Sudan.\r\nTheir interventions focused on Israel’s conduct in Gaza, including loss of civilian life and infrastructure, the need for humanitarian corridors in Gaza, and support for Palestinian self-determination.\r\nFrance, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, raised the joint communiqué issued on Monday by their leaders and Italy. That document expressed “steadfast and united support to the State of Israel” and “unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism.”\r\nBelgium and Czechia also made aligned comments in support of Israel and called for the release of hostages. South Africa, China, and India appealed for de-escalation by all parties, humanitarian assistance and efforts towards the peace process.\r\nNon-members Palestine and Israel also participated in the meeting.\r\nPalestinian Ambassador Ibrahim M. Khraishi appealed for an end to what he termed the ongoing “massacre” in the Gaza strip, listing the casualties that include “more than 1,750 martyrs, more than 500 children and 7,000 injured”.\r\nHe also cited the ongoing destruction in Gaza, the racist and criminal declarations, the cutting of food, electricity, water and fuel, and where Israel representatives had described the Palestinian people as “human animals”.\r\nKhraishi noted that some States had said that they share the values and principles of Israel. “This is not something acceptable for you to associate yourselves with those criminals,” he said.\r\nHe also pointed to the destruction of infrastructure, hospitals and ambulances, saying this would never kill the will and determination of the Palestinian people to achieve their freedom and an end to occupation.\r\nIsraeli Ambassador Meirav Eilon Shahar said more than 1,300 citizens and foreigners had been brutally massacred by Hamas, and that roughly 2,500 terrorists entered the country “to murder, torture, rape, kidnap and behead my people”.\r\nHamas shows no respect for human life and human rights, she added. The group “shot innocent people, blew up whole families in their homes, and they stabbed young children in their beds.”\r\nIn response to the Arab Group statement, the Israeli representative said that ISIS and Hamas were the same sides of the same coin and asked what these States did in response to ISIS.\r\nShahar noted that for years delegations have supported Hamas and its calls for the destruction of the Jewish people. She said others should condemn Hamas and demand the release of hostages. The Ambassador asked other countries to stand with Israel in its war against terror.\r\nThe NGO International Service for Human Rights (ISHR) condemned all crimes under international law committed by both Israel and Palestinian armed groups, saying targeted and indiscriminate attacks against civilians can never be justified.\r\nISHR called for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to accelerate its investigation into serious crimes committed by all parties in Palestine and Israel.\r\nMeanwhile, according to ISHR, the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, established by the Council, should also address the situation within the context of its root causes, which include settler colonialism, apartheid and denial of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and return.",

        "article": "Biden warns Israel against occupying Gaza\r\n\r\nPresident Joe Biden warned Israel against occupying Gaza in one of his most notable public calls for restraint in its response to attacks by Hamas.\r\nIn an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday, Biden said it would be a “big mistake” for Israel to occupy Gaza. Israel has been signaling it is preparing for a ground invasion of Gaza, even as a humanitarian crisis grows inside the coastal Palestinian enclave. Biden has called for the protection of civilians, and the United States has been working to alleviate shortages of food, water and gas.\r\n“What happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people,” Biden told interviewer Scott Pelley.\r\nBiden said he believes Hamas should be eliminated entirely, “but there needs to be a Palestinian Authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state.”\r\nThe comments amount to one of the few times the US president has called on Israel to use some sort of restraint in responding to the Hamas attacks that left 1,400 dead. In its response, Israel unleashed a massive bombing campaign against the northern Gaza Strip, from which Hamas launched its attack.\r\nMichael Herzog, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that Israel does not intend to occupy Gaza after the conflict ends.\r\n“We have no desire to occupy or reoccupy Gaza. We have no desire to rule over the lives of more than 2 million Palestinians,” Herzog said.\r\nIn the “60 Minutes” interview, Biden notably did not say it was time for a ceasefire.\r\n“Look, there’s a fundamental difference. Israel is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust,” he said.\r\n“So I think Israel has to respond. ... The Israelis are gonna do everything in their power to avoid the killing of innocent civilians.”\r\nThe situation in Gaza has quickly become a humanitarian disaster, and the Israelis told civilians living in the northern part of the area to evacuate to the south ahead of an anticipated invasion. However, many human rights organizations have called that impossible as Israeli strikes have damaged infrastructure and Palestinians face a lack of housing in one of the most densely populated places on Earth.\r\nBiden told Pelley he believes that there needs to be a humanitarian corridor to help civilians trapped amid the fighting and that Israel will abide by the “rules of war.”\r\n“I’m confident that Israel is going to act under the measure ... the rules of war,” Biden said. “There’s standards that democratic institutions and countries go by. And so I’m confident that there’s gonna be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water.”\r\nThe president said he does not anticipate American troops engaging in combat in the area as Israel readies its ground counterattack. The US will provide Israel “everything they need,” Biden said.\r\nHe added “there is no clear evidence” that Iran is behind the attacks on Israel.\r\n“Now, Iran constantly supports Hamas and Hezbollah,” Biden said. “I don’t mean that. But in terms of were they, did they have fore knowledge; did they help plan the attack? There’s no evidence of that at this point.”",

        "article": "Despite the truce, people in Gaza will keep dying – this horrifying death toll must never be forgotten\n\nEven if the truce between Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and Hamas results in the promised four-day pause in hostilities – or longer – the horror enveloping Gaza in terms of lives lost is worse than many people think. Among those who oppose Israel’s onslaught, there are still those who do not truly grasp it. It’s understandable that Israeli authorities are seeking to sow doubt about the size of the death toll, because the numbers expose the gravity of the crimes being committed. But we should not be deceived.\nTake the argument that the health ministry is Hamas-run and, therefore, its figures can never be trusted. It sounds like a reasonable enough claim on the surface, until you realise that in previous conflicts the death toll reported by the ministry was largely consistent with the UN’s and even Israel’s counts. Last month, after doubts were raised by President Biden, the ministry even released the names, ages and identification numbers of the victims.\nIndeed, the health ministry’s official estimate – currently 13,300 dead after six weeks – could well be an underestimate, as a senior US official has conceded. The figures do not include the dead buried under rubble who have not been retrieved. According to the independent Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, which is chaired by US emeritus law professor and former UN special rapporteur on Palestine, Richard Falk, the civilian death toll as of 20 November is 16,413, with nearly 34,000 injured. This would mean one in every 142 Palestinian civilians killed in a month and a half.\nGiven that this slaughter may not end soon, the current health ministry tally of 13,300 dead, when placed in the context of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million, tells us something about the sheer scale of what has happened. Comparisons with other conflicts are truly eye-opening here. The Bosnian war loomed over my own childhood as a case study of an unspeakable atrocity. About 40,000 civilians died in those killing fields in the years between 1992 and 1995. That was over three years, not six weeks, and it was in a country whose prewar population was about twice that of Gaza.\nBut aren’t many of the deaths in Gaza not civilians, but Hamas militants, you might ask? The evidence suggests not. Research by the Iraq Body Count project, which diligently compiled violent civilian deaths after the 2003 invasion, concluded last month about Gaza that “few of the victims can have been combatants”. Analysing the ministry of health data, they found only a “modest excess of adult males killed”, which could be explained by their greater exposure to risk in, for instance, rescue efforts. With an estimated 70% of the dead being women and children – and many of the slain men unlikely to have been combatants – their conclusion is difficult to rebut.\nWe could also make a comparison with the war in Syria, rightly regarded as one of the great moral obscenities of our age. The UN estimates that nearly 307,000 civilians have met violent ends since 2011. Its prewar population was just over 10 times that of Gaza. This means that after just six weeks, the death rate of Palestinians is approaching half that of Syrians after a decade of war.\nAfter just six weeks, the death rate of Palestinians is approaching half that of Syrians after a decade of war.\nAnother comparison is Yemen. This is a tragedy close to my heart: I’ve written multiple columns about the western-backed Saudi onslaught and visited a Yemeni refugee camp, where children drew pictures of dead relatives slain by bombs. An estimated 15,000 Yemeni civilians were killed by direct military action between 2015 and 2021, mostly by Saudi-led airstrikes. This is comparable to Gaza, except Yemen’s average population in these war years was 14 times greater than Gaza’s, and this death toll was amassed over six years, not six weeks.\nIt might be countered that Yemen’s death toll is actually closer to 377,000, because of deaths from indirect causes, such as a lack of access to food, water and healthcare. But, of course, the same will be true of Gaza under siege and that figure will only become clear after the current bloodshed is over.\nA comparison of child deaths across conflicts, macabre as it is, underlines the unique nature of this conflict in Gaza. In the first two years of the Syrian war, children were estimated to represent roughly 10% of deaths, in Iraq since 2003, 8.6% and in Ukraine since the invasion, 6%. In Gaza, they represent an estimated 42% of deaths.\nNo comparison is perfect and every tragedy must be understood on its own terms. Yet these numbers give a sense of the unusually brutal scale of what is happening in Gaza. It is not as if the realities on the ground are hidden. Thanks to courageous journalists and media workers – dozens now killed – we have evidence of the civilian toll in the most graphic detail possible. So where is the urgency on behalf of western politicians and many media outlets to put a stop to this? Why doesn’t it rival their justified disgust at the horrors unleashed by Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine? Few cheerleaders of Israel’s invasion have been able to admit that Hamas’s obscene atrocities of 7 October do not justify civilian death on this scale.\nThis truce is welcome but the widespread destruction of infrastructure will mean people keep dying long after the bombs stop falling. And with Israel’s stated desire to occupy Gaza “for an indefinite period” , much violence is surely yet to come. We are left with a bleak conclusion. There isn’t even a pretence that Palestinian life matters. An Israeli civilian death toll of more than 1,000 was rightly understood to be intolerable, but there appears no limit to how many Gazans can meet violent ends. This brazen disregard for innocent life has barely been discussed in the west. It has been widely understood beyond in the Arab world and much of the global south, though, and it will not be forgotten.",

The scene was starkly different on Hayat's return, with all the bodies and much of the debris removed.\nHayat had hoped to find a hole she used as one of her hiding places, but was unable to do so.\nShe jumped nervously each time she heard a loud noise as she wandered around the venue, and at one point she dived to the ground to take cover after what sounded like rocket fire from Gaza. The brother of a friend of Hayat who was killed in the attack consoled her with a hug.\nAlthough her visit brought tears to her eyes, she wiped them away and did not weep openly.\nShe said Hamas started firing rockets into southern Israel as young people were dancing at around 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 7. Shooting began when Hamas gunmen arriving from Gaza reached the music festival, some of them on foot, others on motor-bikes.\nAfter hiding in a hole, she and a man were discovered by the gunmen.\n\"At that time, I was simply talking to God, saying 'There’s nothing more I can do, it’s in your hands now.’ I felt they were going to rape me,\" she said.\nThe man who had been with her was shot dead but Hayat said she managed to escape after one of two gunmen holding her took pity on her.\n\"He simply told me to go as the other terrorist was arguing with him, telling him he wants to murder me, and I could see how they were fighting over whether to kill me or not, and I ran away,\" she said.\nShe then hid under a stage.\n\"While I’m lying under the stage, I see that they're shooting at people to make sure they’re all dead,\" she said. \"So the body lying next to me – they shot him in the head - I took the blood and wiped it on my face and I simply lay still...to seem dead.\"\nHer ordeal ended when Israeli soldiers arrived several hours after the Hamas attack began.\n\"When I heard the army coming...it took me a few minutes to clarify that it was the army I was hearing coming, and then I screamed ‘Help!’ and they came to get me out,\" she said.\n",

Israel has retaliated with air strikes on Gaza that have razed entire districts as it prepares for a possible ground offensive.\r\nIsrael's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant drew international condemnation by announcing on Monday a \"total blockade\" to stop food and fuel reaching Gaza, home to 2.3 million people. Gallant said Israel was battling \"beastly people.\"\r\n\"Such blatant dehumanization and attempts to bomb a people into submission, to use starvation as a method of warfare, and to eradicate their national existence are nothing less than genocidal,\" Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour wrote in a letter to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, seen by Reuters.\r\n\"These acts constitute war crimes,\" he wrote.\r\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that his understanding was that \"the concept of siege is not something that in fact is going to be pursued by the Israeli government,\" adding that Washington was speaking with the Israeli government \"about their actions in this regard.\"\r\nSullivan also said U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday discussed \"the difference between going full bore against Hamas terrorists and how we distinguish between terrorists and innocent civilians.\"\r\nIsrael's U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan on Sunday accused Hamas of war crimes and said it was time to \"obliterate Hamas terror infrastructure,\" as the 15-member U.N. Security Council met behind closed-doors on the conflict.\r\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday said he was \"deeply distressed\" by Israel's announcement of a complete siege on Gaza.\r\n\"The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,\" Guterres said.\r\n",

        "article": "War with Gaza could lead to a new strategic reality for Israel\r\n\r\nLike in 1973, the country is likely to face political churn\r\n\r\nIn October 1973, Israel was caught by surprise in an attack Egypt and Syria launched, coinciding with a major Jewish festival that also fell on a Saturday, the Jewish sabbath. The attack succeeded in catching Israel “cold”, as the nation commemorated the holy day.\r\nRemarkably, almost 50 years to the day, Israel has again been caught by surprise by a devastating assault – leaving many hundreds of its citizens dead – also launched on a Jewish holiday that fell on the sabbath. It is already being dubbed “Israel’s 9/11”.\r\nHow this could have happened again – so eerily echoing the 1973 war failings – will be debated for decades to come.\r\nFor the timing of Hamas’s attack should have been anticipated, particularly given the following indicators: one, months of Israeli and Palestinian violence in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as Israel’s most right-wing government pushed policies that angered Palestinians; two, Israeli government ministers’ visits to Saudi Arabia as it seemed a Saudi-Israel normalisation deal was in the works – a nightmare scenario for Hamas’s backers in Iran, which has been in a hegemonic contest with the Saudis for decades; three, Iran’s desire to seek revenge after numerous Israeli intelligence successes against it in recent years, including many inside the country; and four, the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war, the previous major Arab military success against Israel.\r\nAn Egyptian intelligence official has now said that Israel ignored their repeated warnings that Hamas was planning “something big”, as it focused on the West Bank and possibly played down threats from Gaza.\r\nThe immediate strategic impact will be in halting the Saudi deal, for now anyway.\r\nThe Israeli right have naively believed that regional peace could be achieved without making any political concessions to the Palestinians – even ones just to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank – and that the current status-quo could be controlled by Israel on its own terms. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had proclaimed that Arab states were interested to cultivate relationships with Israel with no such conditions.\r\nThey hoped a deal with Saudi Arabia would be the ultimate proof of this. However, the reality of the Hamas attack – and the long ground assault on Gaza that Israel will almost certainly now embark on – will force a Saudi rethink.\r\nIt is almost inconceivable that Riyadh will risk a deal with Israel right now, in light of the mood that will take hold in the Arab world if and when Israel’s ground assault on Gaza begins, especially as the nascent deal will have included measures to improve Palestinian-Israeli relations. This is a huge win for Iran.\r\nThe 9/11 analogy is thus particularly apt in one key aspect – a powerful state (the US on 9/11, Israel now) underestimating the capability of a foreign “terror” organisation (Al Qaeda then, Hamas now), largely due to underestimating the role an enemy state (Afghanistan then, Iran now) played in augmenting its capacity.\r\nAfter 9/11, it was understood that Taliban-controlled Afghanistan had lent state capacity to Al Qaeda – resulting in the US removing the Taliban from power. Now Iran may have done the same for Hamas.\r\nWhether this raises the possibility of Israel attacking Iran, or not, it is instructive that Tehran has publicly denied direct involvement.\r\nBut the most profound consequence of this “Israeli 9/11” will probably be at the heart of Israeli politics. Fifty years ago, the fallout of the 1973 war was the eventual decline of the left. The Labour Party that had governed Israel since its inception was seen as having lost control, with its focus on domestic ideological causes leading to complacency and catastrophe.\r\nWhen the fighting ends and the battle for the next Israeli election begins, will this period of right-wing dominance – Mr Netanyahu has run the country longer than any other prime minister – also be viewed as one where its leaders’ focus on domestic ideological causes distracted them from defending the state?\r\nMr Netanyahu’s domination of Israeli politics has been based on his national security credentials, but will his leadership survive the scrutiny of the failures that led to the current crisis? The electoral system is fraught with uncertainty, but, together with the huge public outrage against the judicial reforms, a major shake-up of the country’s politics seems certain.\r\nYet the long-term strategic legacy may not play out as might be assumed.\r\nThe 1973 war led Israel to reassess its strategic reality and the status of the land it had taken in 1967. And the Arab world grudgingly had to accept that even when Israel is knocked down, it is very quickly back up fighting. This resulted in the previously unthinkable land-for-peace deal in 1979, Egypt’s recognition of Israel and the return of the Sinai Peninsula to Cairo.\r\nIn time, the 1973 “defeat” thus led to the strengthening of Israel’s security and regional status rather than the diminishing of it. This latest tragedy demands similar introspection and the questioning of Israel’s political direction of travel. Time will tell whether today’s intelligence and security failures will lead to equally dramatic changes in Israel’s strategic outlook.",

Don't paint all Palestinians with Hamas's brush\r\n\r\nThis tiny territory is full of smart, ambitious and industrious people who want to live in peace – just like the rest of the world\r\n\r\nI abhor violence, probably because I have spent more than half my life in the world’s most violent places.\r\nI condemn the killing of any civilians, no matter their faith, race, or creed. I mourn all the dead in Palestine and Israel, and the dead do not distinguish whether they are Jewish, Muslim, Christian or atheist.\r\nThey are all victims of the actions taken by some politicians, warlords and leaders who put the safety of civilians far behind their own quest for power.\r\nSuccessive Israeli governments have subjugated the Palestinian people for 75 years, while yet another military operation carried out by Hamas will once again have a tragic blowback on the Palestinians living in Gaza – the very people they are supposed to represent and protect.\r\nI have worked in Gaza since 1990 and continue to work there. I have relationships that stretch back over decades.\r\nI started out as a young journalist who was horrified by the events of the first intifada. Israeli tactics of torture, deportation, incarceration and indiscriminate attacks against civilians led me to do the work I do today – documenting and cataloguing potential war crimes in Ukraine.\r\nWhile one might be able to hold Israel responsible for certain crimes, I am also aware of the deep fractures in Palestinian political life and their many flaws.\r\nFollowing its actions on Saturday, Hamas has opened the gates of hell against their own people. So much for Hamas 2.0, the supposedly kinder and gentler face of terrorism, which was their last public diplomacy operation a few years ago.\r\nIt is important to remember, however, that all Palestinians should not be painted with Hamas’s violence brush.\r\nThe Israeli government’s collective punishment against all of Gaza for the actions of Hamas – who Israeli officials might say were elected by the people of Gaza, so they all deserve to be punished – is inhumane and a potential war crime.\r\nGaza, an area that is just 40 kilometres long and 12 kilometres wide, houses as many as two million people. The lives of a majority of them are hellish – packed in tightly, subject to blanket Israeli restrictions, and unable to leave the territory even for crucial medical treatment. The list of those who died because they could not leave for chemotherapy or organ transplants is long – and this includes plenty of children.\r\nMy friends in Gaza’s ancient Christian community are forbidden to leave to go to Easter or Christmas in Bethlehem – or one member of the family is permitted, and no one else. The young entrepreneurs – and there are many – are refused exit visas for visits to workshops, scholarships, or conferences in foreign countries.\r\nOn my last trip to Gaza, I decided to focus on the extraordinary talent and resilience of the youth – because two-thirds of Gaza’s two million people are under the age of 25.\r\nThe people I met – computer geeks, rock musicians, artists, poets and female entrepreneurs promoting empowerment – want peace. They don’t want Hamas. They want to live a life that doesn’t mean hiding from bombs and Israel turning off their water and electricity supplies. They want to fall in love, get married, have children, and build better lives. Now that future is shattered.\r\nWhat annoys me more than anything is the coverage by the largely American, but also British, TV presenters who have little knowledge of the history of the occupation, or the suffering that has accompanied it. It is too easy to follow the narrative that Hamas are evil while all Israelis are cast as heroes, who want peace.\r\nWorse is a new geopolitical “theory” linking Palestinians to Russia. Some of the rhetoric I have come across suggests the world is divided between the bad guys – Russia, the Middle East and Iran – on the one side, and the good guys – the western superheroes of Nato, Ukraine and Europe – on the other.\r\nUS President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy do not help by pushing the narrative and unequivocally supporting Israel. In any case, where was Israel when Ukraine needed it? Sitting on the fence.\r\nThe background and the future are just more nuanced and complicated, but this is the simple narrative they are running with because it is easy to swallow.\r\nBeing under aerial bombardment, as I have, is like being in a doll’s house as one tries to find a place to hide while a giant from up above is constantly throwing boulders at the house. There is nowhere for people to run. I was able to leave the places where I was trapped in bombing, but the people of Gaza have no such escape route.\r\nI write this with the heaviest of hearts, because I think of the summer nights a few years ago, sitting at the edge of the Mediterranean in Gaza City with young Gazan friends who had dreams and real hopes of innovations, businesses and creativity. The only way they could do this was if there was a pathway of peace.\r\nBut the Israeli government’s vengeance will destroy Gaza again. It will be rebuilt. Then it will be destroyed again.\r\nWhat the Israeli government does not understand is that every time it bombs a building with families and innocent people inside, it closes several doors to peace. It kills and crushes the best of these young thinkers – the very people it should be cultivating as a new generation of peacemakers.",

        "article": "How do you evacuate 1.1 million people from north Gaza in 24 hours?\r\n\r\nGaza, a sealed-off territory with 2 million trapped inside, is expected to have an Israeli ground invasion\r\n\r\nIsrael’s demand for about 1.1 million Palestinian civilians to leave northern Gaza and head for the south is “impossible” within a 24-hour period, aid groups and experts told The National on Friday.\r\nAnnounced before an expected Israeli ground invasion against Gaza's ruling Hamas militant group, it is an unprecedented order affecting almost half the population of the sealed-off territory.\r\nThe UN, which was informed by Israel of the plans, has said such a large number of people fleeing en masse would be catastrophic, especially as an aerial bombardment continues in Gaza.\r\nGazans, many of whom have been seen fleeing on foot, have to travel about 15km if they live in the northernmost part of the Strip to reach the area south of the Wadi Gaza, which is where the Israelis say they have to flee to.\r\nMost people in Gaza city itself, the most densely populated area and its southern environs, have a 5km to 10km journey.\r\nBut the potential for heavy fighting and the continuing bombardments in some areas, as well as roads blocked by rubble, craters and, potentially, other refugees will make the journey far more arduous, especially with dwindling access to water.\r\nHamas, which staged a brutal surprise attack on Israel this week, dismissed the Israeli announcement as a ploy and called on people to stay in their homes, adding to widespread confusion and panic.\r\nChris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, told The National it was not possible for so many civilians to safely move out of the region within 24 hours.\r\n“The Gaza strip is still being bombed, there is no power, no roads, so it’s impossible,” he said.\r\n“What we see is essentially an example of state terror. It is to actually inform a civilian population this is what is going to happen and they know they cannot leave, so they are aware of what will occur.”\r\nIsrael said early on Friday that it needed to strike Hamas's military infrastructure, much of which is buried deep underground across Gaza.\r\nThe Israeli military will use “significant force” while making “extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians”, army spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said.\r\nThe announcement has triggered panic among civilians and aid workers already sheltering from Israeli air strikes and contending with a total siege and territory-wide power cuts.\r\n“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you’ll make it, if you’re going to live,” Nebal Farsakh, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza city, told news agencies while breaking into heaving sobs.\r\nGaza residents flee south after Israeli army warning\r\nMore than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed and 6,600 wounded in Gaza since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes, Palestinian health officials said.\r\nMore than 1,300 Israelis have been killed and 3,200 wounded, according to the Israeli army, after Hamas launched an attack against Israel from the Gaza Strip on 07 October.\r\n\r\nWill people actually move?\r\nHamas said Israel's Gaza evacuation order had been rejected by “our Palestinian people”.\r\nVideos and pictures shared on social media showed people, with children in their arms, carrying suitcases and plastic bags stuffed with belongings on Friday.\r\nThe UN said that more than 423,000 people have already fled their homes in the territory.\r\nThe World Health Organisation said it was impossible to transfer severely wounded and sick patients to southern Gaza.\r\n“There are severely ill people whose injuries mean their only chances of survival is being on life support, such as mechanical ventilators,” said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.\r\n“So, moving those people is a death sentence. Asking health workers to do so is beyond cruel,” he said.\r\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council said its humanitarian workers inside Gaza reported “countless people in the northern parts who have no means to safely relocate under the constant barrage of fire”.\r\n“The loss of civilian lives caused by deliberate or indiscriminate use of force is a war crime for which the perpetrators will have to answer,” the group said.\r\n“We fear that Israel may claim that Palestinians who could not flee northern Gaza can be erroneously held as directly participating in hostilities, and targeted.”\r\n\r\nWhere can they go?\r\nA total siege has been imposed on Gaza since Saturday. Israel has cut off water, electricity and gas supplies as a response to the attack by Hamas.\r\nIt also shut its own border crossing into the city and has bombed Egypt's Rafah crossing, temporarily rendering it unusable.\r\nFor several days, humanitarian groups have been calling for the safe passage for the two million civilians in Gaza as Israel pounds the enclave with thousands of air strikes.\r\nLeaving would be difficult in the narrow and densely populated Gaza.\r\nBente Scheller, head of the Mena division at the Heinrich Boll Foundation in Berlin, said there was “no where to go” as Egypt was not ready to open its border for refugees.\r\n“Given the level of humanitarian suffering that is already happening – the scarcity of water, food or fuel, it will be very difficult to provide for people in an even more difficult logistical situation,” Ms Scheller told The National.",

        "article": "Israeli war crimes and Western hypocrisy on Gaza\r\n\r\nHypocritical Western nations that often claim the mantle of peace refuse to confront the illegal occupation and hold widespread brutality to account.\r\n\r\n\"Israel’s\" brutal war on Gaza has displaced over 260,000 Palestinians, flattened mosques, and killed over 1,700 innocent Palestinians. Hypocritical Western nations that often claim the mantle of peace refuse to confront the illegal occupation and hold widespread brutality to account.\r\nPalestine’s resistance to systemic Israeli oppression continues to expose the occupation’s dehumanization of indigenous civilians. Legions of Palestinians are well within their rights to refuse an occupation footprint on sovereign lands, showing the mirror to the West.\r\nThe Israeli occupation was stunned by the strategy and outcome of the October 7 attacks, and its war of vengeance on Gaza proves Palestine’s point: that the world’s most belligerent military occupation puts a premium on atrocities in Gaza and against the will of the Palestinian people. As a band of Western nations rush to support Israel’s criminal disregard for international law, the world deserves a thorough accounting of Israeli war crimes in plain sight.\r\nFirst, \"Israel’s\" move to cut off electricity, food, and fuel supplies to Gaza is a blatant war crime. It qualifies as a punitive measure against besieged Palestinians, and renders the apartheid regime guilty through “unlawful collective punishment.” The occupation shows no signs of dialing down its indiscriminate attacks against civilians and is thoroughly mistaken to presume that such violent atrocities will go unnoticed.\r\nTargeting the survival of a besieged population confirms that \"Israel\" wants the world to help justify its colonizing gaze on Palestinian lands. But the further \"Israel\" moves in this direction, the more it will empower Palestine’s undying resistance to respond with twice the force. \"This [Israeli action] risks seriously compounding the already dire human rights and humanitarian situation in Gaza, including the capacity of medical facilities to operate, especially in light of increasing numbers of injured,\" said United Nations Human Rights chief Volker Turk.\r\nSecond, \"Israel\" has made no secret of using prohibited weapons to push for indiscriminate killings in Gaza. Early reports suggest the use of bunker-buster bombs. Their use in tunnels that serve the livelihoods of Palestinian civilians makes clear that this is the occupation’s targeted attempt to endanger civilian neighborhoods. That is a context that strictly prohibits buster bombs under international humanitarian law.\r\nThis is the glaring reality that Western countries want the world to dismiss. Look no further than U.S. President Joe Biden’s prejudiced remarks on \"Israel’s\" war, effectively sponsoring its continuity by refusing to address the root cause of the current escalations. Washington and its allies show no signs of underscoring the merits of Palestine’s unmitigated right to self-defense, which is brazenly targeted through prohibited weaponry.\r\nRather, leaders of the United Kingdom, the US, France, Germany, and Italy released a pro-occupation joint statement. The consensus signaled unwarranted facilitation of Israeli atrocities and overlooked decades of rights encroachment, military repression, and settlements at the expense of Palestinian freedoms. The Geneva Conventions make it abundantly clear that heavy bombs like bunker busters could only be used in \"extreme circumstance of self-defense.” \"Israel’s' use of prohibited weapons against besieged Palestinians reveals the brazen Western double standard on war crimes, and their desire to support a narrative of immunity for the longest belligerent occupation in modern history. Self-defense is the lifeblood of Palestine’s admirable resistance.\r\nThe oppressed can never be weakened by any measure, and the Israeli occupation’s announcement of a “full siege” of Gaza is a further admission of cowardice and illegality. As the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights put it, endangering “the lives of civilians” through sieges is banned under international humanitarian law. Such a move is unquestionably tantamount to a war crime.\r\nAdditional war crimes, such as the brazen killings of Palestinian journalists, confirm that the occupation is squarely responsible for all the consequences that arise out of its state-sponsored belligerence. Western nations love to step up rhetoric on press freedoms as they see fit, but now present deaf ears to fatal assaults and indiscriminate killings of Palestinian journalists in plain sight.\r\nOccupation attempts to crush accountability for celebrated Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh are a case in point that speaks to the climate of violence sustained by the West against all lives that have followed. Make no mistake: \"Israel\" and its partners’ blatant neglect of the root causes of the conflict won’t hold up, and the message from anti-occupation fighters is clear – enough is enough.\r\nThe West is also unqualified to speak of freedom as this is Palestine’s own call, pure and simple. As such, self-defense and self-determination – informed by international law – will prevail, and Palestine’s right to statehood will be safeguarded on Palestine’s own terms. Heavy arms, illegal settlements, and widespread destruction of sovereign property will be met with an even firmer response from scores of Palestinians who are well within their rights to pushback against systemic apartheid.\r\n\"Israel’s\" attempt to lead a pro-occupation narrative at the United Nations has already taken a beating. And as the continuity of the war suggests, there is zero symmetry between an occupation that is empowered by war crimes and a population that resists injustice with ferocity.",

He added that \"Palestinians are asked to live and die according to the diktats of the Israeli occupation.\"\r\nAbu Hamza reiterated the legal right of the Palestinian Resistance to defend its people in the face of crimes that are \"committed every minute,\" adding that the Resistance will continue to relentlessly retaliate against \"Israel\", in the face of a \"barbaric and hysteric\" aggression that reflects the results of ongoing confrontation on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nAbu Obeida sternly warns the IOF\r\nIn a similar light, the military spokesperson for Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, announced that every Israeli targeting of a Palestinian home in Gaza without prior warning will be \"regrettably\" met by executing an Israeli captive.\r\nHe added that the execution process will be broadcast in both audio and video, explaining that this decision came after the Israeli enemy committed several massacres against safe children, women, and the elderly in their homes.\r\nThe Resistance is so far acting in accordance with Islamic rulings by keeping the Israeli captives safe and sound, Abu Obeida stressed.\r\nHowever, he warned that the Israeli occupation entity will be held \"responsible for targeting the Palestinian people, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" adding that \"the Israeli enemy does not understand the language of humanity and ethics, and we will address it in the language it knows.\"\r\nRead more: Resistance still fighting in Gaza Envelope settlements, going strong\r\n\r\n'Israel' compensates for military failure with genocide\r\nThe Israeli occupation Air Force has conducted hundreds of consecutive and violent airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, targeting towers, residential buildings, and service facilities, causing devastating destruction to civilian properties and infrastructure and resulting in the deaths and injuries of mostly women, children, and elderly.\r\nAl Mayadeen's correspondent in Gaza reported that the occupation is employing white phosphorus bombs in its brutal attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.\r\nSince Saturday, when Operation Al-Aqsa Flood was launched, Israeli occupation forces have employed white phosphorus bombs during their airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

I have been doing this for a long time. I never thought that I would see, or have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children.\"\r\nAccording to a White House spokesperson, he based his remarks on statements from the spokesperson of Israeli occupation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Israeli media.\r\nThen an IOF spokesperson told Anadolu Agency that Israelis have no information regarding \"Hamas beheading babies\".\r\nMoreover, the UAE exhibited a glaring inconsistency in its position. Initially, it aligned itself with \"Israel\" by condemning Hamas' operation and providing substantial aid to the occupying force, even as Gaza grappled with dire shortages of necessities.\r\nSubsequently, the UAE chose to dispatch aid to Gaza in an apparent bid for neutrality. Nonetheless, it refrained from censuring the Israeli brutalities in Gaza and the relentless aggression that deliberately targeted civilian homes, resulting in the tragic loss of entire families in a single strike.",

She had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, along with her neighbors.\nHer two older brothers hid in a closet and were thus saved from Hamas. They came to see her on Monday for the first time in 50 days.\n\nThe Brodutch family\nHagar Brodutch was abducted along with her three children, 4-year-old Oria, 8-year-old Yuval, and 10-year-old Ofry. The mother and kids were reunited with Avichai at the Schneider Children's Medical Center.\nOria's wide smile of being reunited with his family back in Israel was in sharp contrast to the heartbroken looks of sister Ofry and mother Hagar.\n\nThe Goldstein-Almog family\nChen Goldstein-Almog was abducted along with her three children, 9-year-old Tal, 8-year-old Gal, and 17-year-old Agam. The father, Nadav, and eldest sister Yam were brutally murdered by Hamas on October 7.\nThe mother and her three kids were reunited with family at the Schneider Children's Medical Center, where grandmother Vara spoke to i24NEWS and told us the children “knew their father and sister were murdered.”\n\nThe Elyakim sisters\nDafna Elyakim, 15-years-old, and her 8-year-old sister Elia were reunited with their mother Maayan Zin. Their father, Noam, was brutally murdered by Hamas on October 7.\n“It is a joy mixed with sadness. Joy for my daughters who are here and sadness for those who have not yet returned. My heart will not be whole again until everyone returns home safely,\" the mother said in a statement.\n\nElma Avraham, 84-years-old\nFollowing her release from seven weeks of captivity Elma Avraham was rushed to the emergency department at Soroka Hospital in Beer Sheba, in critical condition. After almost 24 hours, doctors said her life is still in danger.\nHer daughter, Tal Amano, described how she took her mother’s medications to the Red Cross, which refused taking them. Her son, Uri, described how she was taken away on a motorcycle by the terrorists on October 7.\n\nAviva Siegel, 62-years-old\nThe 62-year-old Aviva Siegel was abducted along with her American-Israeli husband Keith, who is believed to still be held as a hostage by Hamas in Gaza. The two have four children and five grandchildren.\nWolfson Hospital in Holon, where she was transferred upon arrival in Israel, reports that the medical condition has been upgraded to good, saying \"She recovered throughout the night. Our doctors noted that this morning she is alert and relaxed.”\n\nRoni Krivoi, 25-years-old\nThe 25-year-old Roni Krivoi was taken hostage on October 7, he was working as a sound technician at the Nova Music Festival, where terrorists massacred hundreds. The Russian-Israeli man’s release was a gesture of gratitude by Hamas toward a special request by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin for supporting “the Palestinian cause.”\nHis aunt recounted a gripping attempt by Roni to escape the Hamas terrorists holding him in Gaza, during an airstrike on the building, but was discovered and returned to captivity after four days.",

The US has also transferred two aircraft carriers to the Eastern Mediterranean, which is evidence of its unconditional support to the occupation government that has murdered more than 850 children since October 7.\r\nLater on Wednesday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that Biden will also travel to Jordan to meet with King Abdullah II, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\r\n\r\nUS Marine rapid response force heads to occupied Palestine\r\nMoreover, regarding the US military backing of \"Israel\", a US Marine rapid response force is heading to waters off the coast of occupied Palestinian territories, an unnamed defense official told CNN.\r\nThe 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) was deployed alongside the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group. Originally, the group was deployed to the Gulf in order to \"secure international maritime traffic\" following continued aggressive US measures against Iran.\r\nThe force consists of 2,000 Marines and sailors and is expected to provide the needed cover for \"Israel\" as it continues to massacre Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\r\nAccording to CNN, the rapid response force sends \"a message of deterrence to Iran\" and seeks to prevent allies of the Palestinian Resistance from confronting the Israeli occupation.\r\nThe defense official told the news network that it is still unclear if US troops will be deployed into occupied territories, however, they are expected to be stationed in the Red Sea and be prepared for such orders.\r\nOfficials affiliated with parties within the Axis of Resistance, such as Hezbollah, have said that increased US military presence in the region will not deter them from confronting \"Israel\" if need be.\r\n\"Israel\" has been mulling a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip following a humiliating defeat on October 7 and continued confrontations in its aftermath which have left at least 289 of its soldiers and officers dead.\r\nLate on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian stressed that \"the time for these American messages is coming to an end.\"\r\nThe top diplomat warned the Israeli-US alliance against killing any children and women \"before it's too late instead of sending hypocritical messages.\"\r\nHe also reiterated that Iran does not give orders to Resistance factions, underscoring their autonomy in terms of taking action against \"Israel\".\r\n\"If the continuation of war crimes is not stopped and the world does not witness the immediate cessation of crimes, other fronts will be opened.\"",

        "article": "The Single Greatest Threat To America Is Hiding In Plain Sight\r\n\r\nA recent poll reveals that a majority of voters see the opposing political party as the greatest threat to the nation.\r\nThis crisis of faith in democracy is fueled by the constant portrayal of the opposing party as traitors and the constitutional system as flawed.\r\nThe University of Virginia Center for Politics found that 52% of Biden supporters say Republicans are now a threat to American life.\r\n47% of Trump supporters say the same about Democrats.\r\nIntellectual and political elites, along with the media, contribute to this loss of faith by criticizing and calling for radical alterations to the Constitution.\r\nPoliticians have also challenged constitutional values and institutions, further eroding trust.\r\nDespite this growing hostility, there is significant hope in newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) who gave glory to God following his being elected as Speaker, which was confirmed following an unanimous Republican vote.\r\nThis sort of unifying vote has not occurred in 12 years.\r\n“I want to tell all my colleagues here what I told the Republicans in that room last night; I don’t believe there are any coincidences in a matter like this,” Johnson began.\r\n“I believe that Scripture, the Bible, is very clear that God is the one that raises up those in authority. He raised up each of you, all of us, and I believe that God has ordained and allowed each one of us to be brought here for this specific moment in this time,” he said in reference to Romans chapter 13 of the Bible.\r\n“This is my belief. I believe that each one of us has a huge responsibility today to use the gifts that God has given us to serve the extraordinary people of this great country — and they deserve it — and to ensure that our republic remains standing as the great beacon of light and hope and freedom in a world that desperately needs it.”\r\nJohnson then addressed the first bill he would pass, which would secure funding for Israel’s fight against Hamas terrorists.\r\n“The first bill that I’m gonna bring to this floor in just a little while will be in support of our dear, dear friend Israel, and we’re overdue. And given that, we’re going to show not only Israel but the entire world that the barbarism of Hamas that we have all seen play out on our television screens is wretched and wrong. And we’re going to stand for the good in that conflict.”\r\nGOP lawmakers expressed unity and support for Johnson’s leadership, with some highlighting his intellect and character.\r\nLawmakers expressed confidence in the unity and mission of the party moving forward.\r\nRep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, said, “I think it was important to make sure that we got the right person for the American people.”\r\n“Mike is honest, hardworking, and principled — he is a great man and will make a great speaker. I look forward to continuing to work with my good friend to get this country back on track and deliver results for American families who deserve better from Washington,” Scalise said in a statement.",

He has a new ad out saying that Hillary Clinton was your inspiration,” Martha MacCallum said.\r\n“And he plays a number of videos where you say, yes, you know, we differed on certain issues, but she inspired me to get into politics. I saw her speak at The Leadership Institute. I walked out the door and I made my decision to get into politics.”\r\n“You’re shaking your head.”\r\n“No. Because I mean, look, DeSantis is desperate,” Haley said. “He’s lying because he’s losing.”\r\n“But let’s go — the problem is if you have to lie to win, you don’t deserve to win.”\r\n“I never said Hillary Clinton was an inspiration. What I said when I was talking to a group of women, who were looking at running for office, I said the same thing about her that I said about Sarah Palin.”\r\n“And that is when I was looking to run, everybody told me why I couldn’t do it.”\r\n“They said you’re too young. They said you have small children. Oh, you should start at the school board level.”\r\n“And I went to a women’s leadership forum at Furman University and one of the speakers happened to be Hillary Clinton. And I have never agreed with a single thing Hillary Clinton has ever said and I said that, too. But Ron forgot to put that in the ad.”\r\n“But what I’ll tell you is, she ended it by saying, for every reason they tell you not to run, that’s exactly the reason you should. And I left there and said that’s it. I’m running for office. I had never been politically active. I had never been involved in politics.”\r\n“So, they can twist and turn this all they want, but it’s because they see what we see, we’re surging in the polls — not just in Iowa, not just in New Hampshire, not just in South Carolina.”\r\n“But I’ll say that’s the problem with politicians. Rather than talking about what they can do, they just want to talk up and make things up that I — that they are saying that I said.”\r\n“I’m happy to dispute it every day of the week. But at the end of the day, I’d rather be talking about inflation and our economy and education, and how we have to go back to the basics and get our kids reading again.”\r\n“About a border that’s out of control. About the fact that we need law and order back in this country and that we need a strong America that we can be proud of again. And that’s what I’m going to stay focused on.”",

Any moral equivalence drawn between Israel and Hamas is simple Jew-hatred,” wrote Shapiro.\r\n“When you support Hamas and its agenda, you are supporting the barbaric murder of babies in their cribs; you are supporting women being kidnapped, raped, and murdered.”\r\n“The answer is simple: the West is embarrassed of its own values,” Shapiro continued. “And this embarrassment has led it down the road of blindness. The West has decided that in order to avoid accusations of ethnocentricity, it must make a core assumption: everyone thinks like us.”\r\nHe emphasized that the fight against Hamas is not just about Israel defending itself, but about the West defending its values and existence.\r\nShapiro warned that if the West does not defend itself, it will cease to exist.\r\n“Now, it is patently obvious that everyone does not think like us,” he continued. “People who kill babies for the crime of being Jews are not like us. People who paraglide into electronic dance music festivals and gleefully rape women, murder 260 people, and drag innocents back to their hellholes in Gaza are not like us.”\r\n“Today, the existence of the State of Israel means that Jews need not wait for anyone else to come to the realization that monsters exist and evil is real. But the West must too come to that realization,” Shapiro wrote. “Not for the Jews. Not for Israel. But because if the West does not defend itself, it will cease to exist. And the monsters will win.”",

I’m not aware that there’s been such a characterization of that.”\r\nThis response has raised concerns and frustrations among many Americans who feel that the administration is not directly addressing the seriousness of anti-Semitic threats.\r\nSenator Josh Hawley questioned Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employee who made controversial social media posts praising terrorists.\r\nHawley presented examples of extreme rhetoric and asked Mayorkas if this was typical of DHS employees.\r\nSen. Hawley asked Mayorkas; “What about people who say things like, on October the seventh, ‘F Israel’ — I’m cleaning up the language here — ‘F Israel, the government and its military, are you ready for your downfall?’ People who say things like, ‘F Israel and any Jew who supports Israel. May your conscience haunt your dreams until your last breath. Palestine will be free one day. F apartheid Israel,’ This is pretty extreme rhetoric, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\nSenator Hawley GRILLS Mayorkas over REFUSING to fire a DHS employee who repeatedly praised Hamas 🔥\r\n— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) October 31, 2023\r\n\r\nMayorkas denounced the question and stated that the employee in question was on administrative leave, but refused to comment further on the personnel matter.\r\n“I’m sorry, this person works for the Department of Homeland Security, have you fired her?” asked Hawley of Mayorkas.\r\nMayorkas replied, “Your question to suggest that that is emblematic of the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security is despicable.\r\n\r\nBravo to Senator Hawley.\r\nAn employee of DHS is celebrating the death of Jews and this is the response of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas…\r\n“Has this employee been fired?”\r\nMayorkas NEVER confirms.\r\nBut the Biden Administration stands with Israel right?\r\n— Wesley Hunt (@WesleyHuntTX) October 31, 2023\r\n\r\nA visibly frustrated Hawley said, “Don’t come to this hearing room when Israel has been invaded and Jewish students are barricaded in libraries in this country and cannot be escorted out because they are threatened for their lives.”\r\nAdding, “You have employees who are celebrating genocide, and you are saying it’s despicable for me to ask the question? Has she been fired?”\r\nMayorkas eventually admitted that the employee was on administrative leave.\r\nHawley criticized Mayorkas for not taking action and accused him of being disrespectful.\r\n\r\nJUST IN: Senator Josh Hawley excoriates DHS Secretary Mayorkas for failing to take action against his pro-Hamas employee.\r\nThe incident came after Mayorkas called Hawley “despicable” after Hawley asked why the DHS was employing pro-terrorist people.\r\n— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) October 31, 2023",

        "article": "'You F------ Idiots': Actress Julianna Margulies Slams Black and LGBTQ Supporters of Palestine\n\nJulianna Margulies recently claimed that Black and LGBTQ+ supporters of Palestine are “brainwashed to hate Jews.”\n\nThe Morning Show star Julianna Margulies recently claimed that Black and LGBTQ+ supporters of Palestine are “brainwashed to hate Jews” amid Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas, RadarOnline.com has learned.\nIn a shocking development to come nearly two months after the Palestinian terrorist group attacked southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, Margulies appeared on a podcast where she criticized those who refuse to stand up for Israel amid the subsequent war.\nAccording to The Morning Show actress, the Black and LGBTQ+ supporters of Palestine are “f---ing idiots” because “Black” and “gay” individuals would be the “first people beheaded” if they “stepped foot” in Palestine.\n“It’s those kids who are spewing this anti-Semitic hate that have no idea if they stepped foot in an Islamic country […] it’s those people that will be the first people beheaded and their heads played like a soccer ball,” Margulies said on The Back Room with Andy Ostroy podcast.\n“I want to say to them: You f---ing idiots, you don’t exist,” she continued. “You’re even lower than the Jews. You’re Black. You’re gay. You’re turning your back against the people who support you.”\nShe also suggested that those who support Palestine have been “brainwashed to hate Jews.”\n“Because the fact that the entire Black community isn’t standing with us, to me, says they don’t know, or they’ve been brainwashed to hate Jews,” the actress argued.\nMargulies, who plays a gay journalist on The Morning Show, then targeted those in Hollywood who refuse to support Israel amid the country’s war against Hamas in Gaza.\nThe 57-year-old Jewish actress admitted that she was “stunned” by the Hollywood industry and compared the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East to the death of George Floyd in May 2020.\n“Can you imagine the WGA not putting out a statement after George Floyd?” Margulies said. “And yet when it was the Jews – by the way, all of our great material on television is pretty much from the Jews – they stayed silent until they were pressured.”\nAccording to Margulies, the popular social media platform TikTok is to blame for the recent rise in antisemitism across the country.\nShe called for a TikTok ban to curb the number of “crazy people” obtaining their news from the social media site.\n“I guess what’s happening to the crazy people out there who are getting their news from TikTok, which in my estimation – after this whole Osama bin Laden letter – should be banned,” The Good Wife actress said. “TikTok should be banned.”\nAs RadarOnline.com previously reported, several celebrities have come under fire for speaking out about the devastating conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nScream actress Melissa Barrera was removed from the hit horror franchise after she showed solidarity with Palestine last month, while supermodel Gigi Hadid was forced to apologize this week after she claimed that Israeli forces were “abducting, raping, and torturing” innocent Palestinians.",

        "article": "State Patrol use-of-force trainer says Londregan ‘acted in accordance with his training’\r\n\r\nSgt. Jason Halvorson says the author of the criminal complaint against Trooper Ryan Londregan has “lied by omission.”\r\n\r\nA Minnesota State Patrol use-of-force coordinator said in a sworn affidavit filed with the court Wednesday that Trooper Ryan Londregan “acted in accordance with his training” when he shot Ricky Cobb last summer.\r\n“Trooper Londregan acted in accordance with his training; Trooper Londregan did not violate the use-of-force General Orders including, but not limited to the use-of-force policy found at § 10-027,” wrote Sgt. Jason Halvorson, who has worked in law enforcement for 29 years and serves as a use-of-force coordinator for the Minnesota State Patrol Training and Development Section.\r\nHalvorson said he was the use-of-force coordinator for a training academy attended by Trooper Londregan, who is currently facing three felony charges, including second-degree unintentional murder, in connection to Cobb’s death last July.\r\nCobb, a convicted felon, attempted to flee law enforcement in a vehicle while a state trooper was half-inside, half-outside the vehicle. In response, Londregan shot Cobb as a fellow state trooper was dragged for a short distance by Cobb’s vehicle.\r\nIn January, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty announced that her office would file charges against Londregan. Since then, the case has attracted significant media attention, particularly surrounding Moriarty’s handling of the case. Public officials across Minnesota have called for the charges against Londregan to be dismissed while various police associations have asked Gov. Tim Walz to remove the case from Moriarty’s office, especially in light of a filing that claims Moriarty’s own handpicked use-of-force expert called Londregan’s actions “reasonable.”\r\nIn his declaration, Halvorson states that he was interviewed by two deputy county attorneys and is referred to as “Trainer A” in the criminal complaint filed against Londregan. According to Halvorson, the author of the complaint has “lied by omission.”\r\n“The author of the complaint (signed by [Deputy County Attorney Mark] Osler) has cherry-picked one sentence from a 37-page interview transcript and excluded critical facts and context thereby purposefully misleading the reader of the complaint,” Halvorson said.\r\nHe noted that he has not performed a “complete use-of-force review of Trooper Londregan’s officer involved shooting,” which would require interviewing Londregan.\r\nRather, he “reviewed the criminal complaint against Trooper Londregan, my voluntary interview with the BCA, my voluntary interview with Mssrs. Larson and Osler which was attended by the BCA, my testimony to the grand jury in Trooper Londregan’s case, publicly available video of Trooper Londregan’s officer involved shooting, the State Patrol General Orders, and applicable training materials.”\r\nGov. Walz indicated during a press conference this week that he hasn’t ruled out transferring the case to the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office.",

It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country.” He went on to say the Chinese are “not gonna sell those cars” that way, and went on to talk about a friend who manufactures cars in the U.S.\r\nMany Democrats and media outlets took the quote out of context to falsely suggest that Trump was implicitly or explicitly calling for political violence if he loses in November.\r\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, quoting an NBC News article claiming that “Trump says there will be a ‘bloodbath’ if he loses the election,” said, “No, there will not be,” and that both the winner and loser of the presidential election will work together “like patriots who love our democracy” instead.\r\nSen. Amy Klobuchar repeated the inference that “bloodbath” referred to political violence and said that “our very democracy” depends on re-electing Joe Biden in November.\r\nMinnesota’s other U.S. senator, Tina Smith, also suggested that Trump was referring to some form of political violence if he loses the election.\r\n\r\nLots of headlines about Trump out there today, so here’s a quick roundup.\r\nDonald Trump:\r\n— Wants a national abortion ban\r\n— Can’t pay his New York bond\r\n— Suggests a ‘bloodbath’ if he loses again\r\n— Tina Smith (@TinaSmithMN) March 18, 2024\r\n\r\nAlso stirring controversy were remarks Trump made about MS-13 and other criminal migrants crossing the Mexican border into America. Arguing that Latin American countries are bringing their prisoners to the border to enter America, he said, “These are hardened criminals” who are “not people … these are animals, okay? We can’t have another Laken [Riley].”\r\nThe Star Tribune, republishing an article from The New York Times, ran a headline claiming “Trump says some migrants are ‘not people,’” inferring that he meant migrants in general rather than criminals and gang members.\r\nFormer Minnesota State Rep. Carlos Mariani quoted the same New York Times article, calling Trump “disgusting and hateful.” Referring to Trump’s “bloodbath” comment and his comments about violent criminals, he called Trump “pathetic” and said his “words give permission to hurt others.”\r\n\r\nHe’s disgusting and hateful. History is full of of pathetic men like him whose words give permission to hurt others.\r\nThreatens our ability to be a civilized people.\r\nAmerica deserves way better. \r\n— Carlos Mariani (@Cmarianirosa) March 17, 2024\r\n\r\nTrump was in Ohio to support the Senate candidacy of Bernie Moreno, a Colombian immigrant who was born in Bogota and moved to America with his family when he was five years old. Moreno became a U.S citizen upon turning 18, and was a successful entrepreneur before turning to politics.",

        "article": "Supreme Court justices consider whether feds can regulate speech on social media\r\n\r\nDuring the arguments, justices seemed to express doubts about a prior ruling that limited federal cooperation and coercion of social media companies.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday in a case evaluating how the federal government censored Americans’ speech online, especially about COVID-19 and other controversial topics.\r\nDuring the arguments, justices seemed to express doubts about a prior ruling that limited federal cooperation and coercion of social media companies, particularly when the federal government pushes those companies to censor Americans’ speech.\r\n“My biggest concern is that your view has the First Amendment hamstringing the government in significant ways in the most important time periods,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said during oral arguments for Murthy v. Missouri Monday.\r\nShe added that “some might say that the government actually has a duty to take steps to protect the citizens of this country, and you seem to be suggesting that that duty cannot manifest itself in the government encouraging or even pressuring platforms to take down harmful information … .”\r\nThe case, a legal culmination of years of COVID-era controversy, comes after years of outcry over social media companies’ decisions on what to censor, and what not to censor, when it comes to COVID-19, the elections, former President Donald Trump, Hunter Biden, and more.\r\nIn 2023, U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty ruled that the federal government had gone too far and violated the First Amendment when working with private companies to quash speech and said that communication between the federal government and social media companies of this kind was off-limits.\r\n“Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits in establishing that the government has used its power to silence the opposition,” Doughty said. “Opposition to COVID-19 vaccines, opposition to COVID-19 mask and lockdowns, opposition to the lab leak theory of COVID-19, opposition to the validity of the 2020 election, opposition to President Biden’s policies, statements that the Hunter Biden laptop was true, and opposition to policies of the government officials in power. All were suppressed. It is quite telling that each example or category of suppressed speech was conservative in nature.”\r\nThe Biden administration appealed, and now the issue is before the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule by the summer.\r\nDuring oral arguments, even justices seen as more conservative-leaning raised concerns, such as Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who suggested the ban on cooperating between feds and social media companies could be too “sweeping.”\r\nCritics of the Biden administration say the federal government clearly abused its power in recent years and needs to be reined in to prevent future abuses.\r\nThe issue has significant political interests, as The Center Square previously reported. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, pointed to Doughty’s comments when he led a hearing last year going after the FBI for its role in pressuring social media companies to censor certain COVID-19 information as well as the Hunter Biden laptop story just weeks before the presidential election.\r\nThe laptop, and many of the controversial COVID-19 concerns, were later validated.\r\n“American speech is censored, parents are called terrorists, Catholics are called radicals, and I haven’t even talked about the spying that took place of a presidential campaign or the raiding of a former president’s home,” Jordan said at the hearing last year. “But maybe what’s more frightening is what happens if you come forward and tell Congress … you will be retaliated against.”\r\nAt the hearing, Wray pushed back against Jordan’s claims, saying the agency is not biased.\r\n“The idea that I am biased against conservatives seems somewhat insane to me given my own personal background,” said Wray, who is reportedly a registered Republican.",

        "article": "GOP senator accuses DFL colleagues of ‘playing politics’ with her straw purchasing bill\r\n\r\nRepublican Sen. Julia Coleman says Democrats stalled her bill last year after it advanced in a key committee; DFLers voted it down on the Senate floor Thursday and now have their own version.\r\n\r\nCould a bill that a Minnesota senator introduced and advanced with bipartisan support through a committee in the legislature last year have prevented the murder last month of two Burnsville police officers and a firefighter?\r\nSen. Julia Coleman wouldn’t say that outright. But she intimated during a press conference Thursday that her proposal, SF733, which would increase the penalty for an illegal straw purchase of a firearm from a gross misdemeanor to a felony, could make someone think twice.\r\n“I can’t help but think what the woman who bought this man these firearms illegally would have thought if she knew the severity of the law in Minnesota was higher,” Coleman, a second-term Republican from Waconia, told media Thursday morning, just before she invoked a Senate rule to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, which was voted down by the DFL majority.\r\n“We could have done something about this last year,” Coleman said. “We can do something about this today. And I will not stand here and let Democrats play political games, say Republicans can’t get a ‘win’ on this, stand on the graves of three men and play partisan politics while they abuse their power, when we can do something about this, today.”\r\n\r\nDemocrats expressed support one year ago, then bill stalled\r\nDuring the 2023 legislative session, Coleman’s bill received a hearing in the Senate Judiciary and Public Safety Committee.\r\nColeman told her colleagues during the March 23, 2023, hearing that “by raising the penalty for this crime to a felony I believe we will send a strong message to our prosecutors and law enforcement that the legislature intends for these crimes to be taken seriously, and that the penalty will be worth their time in investigation and prosecution.”\r\nThe proposal passed on a unanimous voice vote from all 10 members of the committee (six Democrats, four Republicans). But the bill never got a hearing at its next committee stop, and has been in legislative limbo for nearly a year.\r\nThat is until Coleman invoked a Senate rule (5.1) on Thursday and asked her colleagues to move the bill onto the General Register so it could receive a floor vote.\r\nShe made the claim earlier in the day during a press conference and that afternoon during an interview with WCCO Radio that Democrats have been and continue to “play partisan politics” over the bill and that her colleague Sen. Heather Gustafson, DFL-Vadnais Heights, introduced a bill that “cloned” Coleman’s bill in its language.\r\n“What was explained to me by Sen. Gustafson is that Republicans can’t be the ones that pass this bill,” Coleman said. “That she will be copying my bill verbatim and be moving forward with it. They are standing on the graves of three men, three heroes, to score political points when this could have passed last year, and Democrats held it off.”\r\nGustafson told a media scrum on Thursday afternoon that she recalled the conversation differently.\r\n“I don’t believe I said ‘a Republican can’t pass this bill,’” Gustafson said, according to KTTC News. “What I think I said was that I was willing and already had relationships in place with stakeholders. I’m in a better position to pass this bill.”\r\nOn Friday, the Senate Judiciary and Public Safety Committee was scheduled to hear both Coleman’s and Gustafson’s identical bills “concurrently.”\r\nDuring the Thursday floor debate over the issue, Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, asked his Democratic colleagues to oppose Coleman’s motion to give the bill a full vote on the Senate floor.\r\n“I appreciate the sense of urgency and the desire to move a bill like this forward, and I am supportive of the policy behind it,” said Latz, who chairs the Senate Judiciary and Public Safety Committee that unanimously approved the bill one year ago.\r\nDespite that, Latz asked Coleman if she would like the bill heard in his committee again, even as he made reference to the news that the girlfriend of the shooter had illegally purchased the guns for him that he used to murder Burnsville police officers Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge, both 27, and 40-year-old fire medic Adam Finseth. Last week U.S. Attorney Andy Luger announced that Ashley Anne Dyrdahl has been federally charged with 11 felony counts related to those illegal straw purchases. The shooter, Shannon Cortez Gooden, was prohibited from possessing firearms.\r\n“Since that time, of course, there have been some public incidents, and there has also been a fiscal evaluation on this,” Latz said. “So I think because the judiciary committee is going to be hearing a number of gun violence prevention bills tomorrow, this topic would fit in well with that and I think it is more appropriate for this to be returned to the judiciary committee for that purpose.”\r\nColeman turned down the offer and alleged that Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, has refused for the last year to give the bill a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee, its next scheduled stop. Marty serves as chair for that committee. Marty spoke to the bill on the Senate floor Thursday but did not explain why he never gave the bill a hearing last year or during the 2024 session.\r\nColeman reiterated her desire to see the bill passed immediately.\r\n“This motion is urgent because three heroes were murdered. And we have the ability to do something about it today,” Coleman said. “Not kick the can down the road. Not play political games, but do something about it today. And I urge members to vote to have this discussion right now.”\r\nColeman’s motion failed 34-33, on a party-line vote. The six Democrats who voted last year to support Coleman’s bill during its initial hearing include: Latz, Clare Oumou Verbeten and Sandy Pappas of St. Paul, Jim Carlson of Eagan, Bonnie Westlin of Plymouth and Judy Seeberger of Afton.\r\nThe saga over the issue in the Senate follows a debate in the House of Representatives last week that played out in a similar manner, where Republican lawmakers brought a motion to suspend House rules and declare an urgency to pass HF548, the companion to Coleman’s Senate bill.\r\n“The DFL’s lack of urgency and repeated refusals to even give this bill a hearing is incomprehensible,” said Rep. Peggy Scott, R-Andover, chief author of the House version. “I’ve advocated for and carried this bill for five years. The sobering question is, would our three fallen first responders be alive today if the bill had passed even last year?”\r\nDemocrats in the House on Thursday heard their own version of that bill that Rep. Kaela Berg, DFL-Burnsville, is authoring. Berg voted against Scott’s bill last week.",

        "article": "Supreme Court to hear arguments in Biden admin’s censorship of social media posts\r\n\r\nOral arguments are set for March 18 before the Supreme Court in a case that accuses the Biden administration of a censorship-by-proxy scheme.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear oral arguments in a case that concerns what two lower courts found to be a “coordinated campaign” by top Biden administration officials to suppress disfavored views on key public issues like COVID-19 vaccine side effects and pandemic lockdowns.\r\nThe Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing on March 18 in a case known as Murthy v. Missouri, which started when the attorneys general of two states, Missouri and Louisiana, filed suit alleging that social media companies like Facebook were blocking access to their platforms or suppressing posts on controversial subjects.\r\nThe initial lawsuit, later modified by an appeals court, accused Biden administration officials of engaging in what amounts to government-led censorship-by-proxy by pressuring social media companies to take down posts or suspend accounts.\r\nSome of the topics that were targeted for downgrade and other censorious actions included voter fraud in the 2020 election, the COVID-19 lab leak theory, vaccine side effects, the social harm of pandemic lockdowns, and the Hunter Biden laptop story.\r\nThe plaintiffs argued that high-level federal government officials were the ones pulling the strings of social media censorship by coercing, threatening, and pressuring social media companies to suppress Americans’ free speech.\r\n\r\n‘Unrelenting pressure’\r\nIn a landmark ruling, a judge at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana granted a temporary injunction blocking various Biden administration officials and government agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI from collaborating with big tech firms to censor posts on social media.\r\nLater, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the district court’s ruling, saying it was “correct in its assessment — ‘unrelenting pressure’ from certain government officials likely ‘had the intended result of suppressing millions of protected free speech postings by American citizens,'” the judges wrote. “We see no error or abuse of discretion in that finding.”\r\nThe ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court and, in an Oct. 20 decision, the high court agreed to hear the case while also issuing a stay that indefinitely blocked the lower court order restricting the Biden administration’s efforts to censor disfavored social media posts.\r\nSupreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas would have denied the Biden administration’s application for a stay.\r\n“At this time in the history of our country, what the Court has done, I fear, will be seen by some as giving the Government a green light to use heavy-handed tactics to skew the presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news,” Justice Alito wrote in a dissenting opinion.\r\n“That is most unfortunate.”\r\nThe Supreme Court has other social media cases on its docket, including a challenge to Republican-passed laws in Florida and Texas that prohibit large social media companies from removing posts because of the views they express.\r\nOral arguments were heard on Feb. 26 in the Florida and Texas cases, with debate focusing on the validity of laws that deem social media companies “common carriers,” a status that could allow states to impose utility-style regulations on them and forbid them from discriminating against users based on their political viewpoints.\r\nThe tech companies have argued that the laws violate their First Amendment rights.\r\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in the Florida and Texas cases by June 2024.\r\n\r\n‘Far beyond’ constitutional\r\nSome of the controversy in the Murthy v. Missouri case centers on whether the district court’s injunction blocking Biden administration officials and federal agencies from colluding with social media companies to censor posts was overly broad.\r\nIn particular, arguments have been raised that the injunction would prevent innocent or borderline government “jawboning,” such as talking to newspapers about the dangers of sharing information that might aid terrorists.\r\nBut that argument doesn’t fly, according to Philip Hamburger, CEO of the New Civil Liberties Alliance, which represents most of the individual plaintiffs in Murthy v. Missouri.\r\nIn a series of recent statements on the subject, Mr. Hamburger explained why he believes that the Biden administration’s censorship was “far beyond anything that could be constitutional” and that concern about “innocent or borderline” cases is unfounded.\r\nFor one, he said that the censorship that is highlighted in Murthy v. Missouri relates to the suppression of speech that was not criminal or unlawful in any way.\r\nFurther, he argued that “the government went after lawful speech not in an isolated instance, but repeatedly and systematically as a matter of policy,” which led to the suppression of entire narratives rather than specific instances of expression.\r\n“The government set itself up as the nation’s arbiter of truth — as if it were competent to judge what is misinformation and what is true information,” Mr. Hamburger wrote.\r\n“In retrospect, it turns out to have suppressed much that was true and promoted much that was false,” he added.\r\nThe suppression of reports on the Hunter Biden laptop on the eve of the 2020 election on the premise that it was Russian disinformation, for instance, was later shown to be unfounded.\r\nSome polls show that, if voters had been aware of the report, they would have voted differently.",

It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country,” he said.\r\nHe then went back to speaking about how China will not be able to sell any cars in the United States if he’s reelected.\r\nAfter the “bloodbath” comment, media outlets including NBC News, CBS News, ABC News, NPR, the Guardian, and Yahoo, failed to mention that he was speaking within the context of the auto industry in the United States. Some, like Politico, even stated that it “was unclear what the former president meant.”\r\nSome Democratic politicians, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), also claimed his comments will spark another breach of the U.S. Capitol.\r\nThe Biden campaign seized on his remarks in Ohio on Saturday. “This is who Donald Trump is: a loser who gets beat by over 7 million votes and then instead of appealing to a wider mainstream audience doubles down on his threats of political violence,” Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement to news outlets.\r\nHowever, Republicans pointed out that the word was taken out of context and that legacy news outlets were misleading the public.\r\n“Here we go again folks. The propaganda campaign is in full effect against Trump taking the bloodbath statement out of context,” wrote Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) on X on Sunday.\r\nOne Republican who has been critical of the former president came to his defense on Sunday morning, noting the context. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) noted to NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that the word bloodbath has multiple meanings.\r\n“You could also look at the definition of bloodbath and it could be an economic disaster. And so if he’s speaking about the auto industry, in particular in Ohio, then you can take it with a little bit more context,” he said.\r\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday also told CBS News that President Trump “was clearly talking about the impact of imports devastating the American automotive industry.”\r\nAnd X owner Elon Musk posted the entire video of President Trump’s remarks about the auto industry’s problems on his platform, later writing: “Easy to tell who is an NPC today,” referring to people who didn’t question the “bloodbath” narrative pushed by those outlets. NPC, a term that originated from video games that means “non-player character,” refers to people who cannot think for themselves and cannot make their own decisions.\r\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told outlets on Sunday that the former president was talking about the auto industry and broader economy.\r\n“Crooked Joe Biden and his campaign are engaging in deceptively, out-of-context editing,” he said.\r\nAlso on Saturday, President Trump said that President Biden poses a threat to Social Security after he made comments earlier this week that suggested he would look at reforming the program.\r\n“You will not be able to have Social Security with this guy in office because he’s destroying the economics of our country. And that includes Medicare, by the way, and American seniors are going to be in big trouble,” he warned, adding, “I made a promise that I will always keep Social Security, Medicare. We always will keep it. We never will cut it.”\r\nHe was in Ohio to stump for Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, who is running for the seat that is currently occupied by Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).",

        "article": "There ‘could be’ deal with Hamas to release Israeli hostages: Netanyahu\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed cautious hope for a deal to secure the release of more hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed cautious hope for a deal to secure the release of more hostages held by the Islamist group Hamas, who have been held for more than a month after the brutal October attack.\n“There could be (an agreement), but I think the less I say about it, the more I increase the chances it materialises,” Mr Netanyahu said in an interview with U.S. broadcaster NBC on Sunday.\nIf a deal is reached, it will only be the result of military pressure, Netanyahu said, adding, “That’s the one thing that might create a deal.”\nMr Netanyahu argued it was also only the Israeli military’s ground offensive in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip that had created any movement in negotiations.\n“If a deal is available, well, we’ll talk about it when it’s there. We’ll announce it if it’s achieved,” he went on.\nNBC and other U.S. media outlets reported, citing government sources, that there were discussions that Hamas could release around 80 women and children in return for Palestinian women and teenagers detained in Israel.\nThere was no official confirmation of this. Netanyahu also did not go into any details of a potential deal.\nU.S. President Joe Biden’s National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, told ABC that negotiations were under way, with Qatar involved and the U.S. government actively engaged.\n“There are efforts to secure a deal that would involve the release of hostages,” Mr Sullivan said, adding that Mr Biden would not rest until such an agreement was reached.\n“I have to be careful about what I say publicly about this because it is of course a delicate and sensitive negotiation,” Mr Sullivan said.\nHamas is still holding 239 hostages, according to Israel.\nThe statements came as heavy fighting continued in Gaza, with violence near the strip’s main hospital escalating fears about the fate of staff and patients as fast-depleting fuel supplies widened the humanitarian crisis among Palestinian civilians.\nThe situation in the al-Ahli hospital, the only hospital in Gaza City still running, “is catastrophic,” said Ghassan Abu Sitta.\nHe said he had performed more than 10 very painful surgical procedures on people without anaesthesia and that blood supplies have also run out.\nGaza’s medical facilities are in increasing focus as the conflict rages on.\nSitta moved there from al-Shifa, the biggest medical complex in the Gaza Strip, now caught up in Israel’s ground offensive.\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) say Hamas has an underground control centre near al-Shifa and is using the hospital as a shield.\nMany fear the building could soon be the target of a major attack.\nSome 10,000 people are still in the hospital, witnesses say, including some too injured to be moved.\nAl-Shifa director Mohammad Abu Salamia said 40 children in critical condition could die at any moment.\nMr Salamia also denied Israeli statements that his hospital rejected fuel supply under pressure from Hamas, calling the claims a “lie and defamation.”\nHis response came after the Israeli foreign ministry reported that Hamas, which rules Gaza, prevented the hospital from using 300 litres of fuel that Israeli soldiers had placed in containers next to the hospital on Saturday evening.\nMr Salamia did not deny the reports about the containers but said the quantity would not be enough to run the hospital generators for “15 minutes.”\nHe said his team was afraid of being shot at if they left the hospital in order to take the containers.\nIf Israel really wanted to supply fuel, it could have sent it in cooperation with the Red Cross or another international organization, he said.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says conditions in the hospital are catastrophic, with care barely possible due to the nearby fighting and lack of fuel.\nEarlier, the WHO lost contact with staff at al-Shifa. In the last two days the hospital in Gaza City had reportedly been “attacked multiple times, leaving several people dead and many others injured,” the organisation said.\nWitnesses saw tanks surrounding the hospital, the WHO said.\nAll of Gaza’s hospitals are struggling, and videos and photos shared online show dozens of injured men, women and children lying on the floor of crowded corridors, waiting for treatment.\nGaza as a whole has been under intense bombardment by Israel since the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7, which left about 1,200 people in Israel dead. Israeli ground forces have now penetrated deep into Gaza.\nThe Israeli attacks since October 7 have killed over 11,000 people according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.\nIsrael’s army says it is not deliberately targeting the health facility, but going after militants.\nThere were also further clashes on the Israeli-Lebanese border. There have been exchanges of fire on the border almost every day since the war began, leading to fears the war could spread to further fronts.\n“An IDF fighter jet and aircraft struck a number of terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization, including a military compound containing a weapons storage facility and military infrastructure,” the Israeli military said in the evening.\nThat came after Lebanese state news agency NNA reported that Israeli warplanes and drones had been flying over the border area and attacking targets since the morning.",

Axios reported that Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, was also pausing its ads.\r\nIBM on Thursday halted its advertising on X after a report found its ads were placed next to content promoting Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Media Matters said it found that corporate advertisements by IBM, Apple, Oracle and Comcast’s Xfinity were being placed alongside antisemitic content.\r\nAdvertisers have fled the site, formerly called Twitter, since Musk bought it in October 2022 and reduced content moderation, resulting in a sharp rise in hate speech on X, according to civil rights groups.\r\nRepresentatives for Musk and X on Friday again declined to comment on his post.\r\n“When it comes to this platform — X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There’s no place for it anywhere in the world — it’s ugly and wrong. Full stop,” X CEO Linda Yaccarino wrote on Thursday.\r\nAntisemitism has been on the rise in recent years in the United States and worldwide. Following the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas after last month’s attack, antisemitic incidents in the United States rose by nearly 400 percent from the year-earlier period, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit organization that fights antisemitism.\r\nMusk, chief executive of electric vehicle maker Tesla and founder of rocket company SpaceX, has blamed the Anti-Defamation League for the ongoing drop in advertisers, without offering any evidence.",

        "article": "Sri Lankan mosques hold prayers for Palestinians killed by Israeli attacks\r\n\r\nMosques across Sri Lanka on Friday dedicated prayers to the thousands of Palestinian civilians killed in the ongoing Israeli attacks on Gaza.\r\nMore than 11,470 Palestinians have been killed and many others wounded since the deadly onslaught began on Oct. 7. Two-thirds of the dead are women and children, according to Palestinian health authorities.\r\nThe UN humanitarian affairs office estimates that around 2,700 people — including 1,500 minors — are missing. They are believed to be buried in the ruins of buildings destroyed by Israeli bombs.\r\n“We organized special prayers today, with the recitation of qunut in sympathy with the Palestinian brethren who are dying daily with their little ones,” Basheer Latheef, chief trustee of the Wekanda Mosque in Colombo, told Arab News. Qunut is the supplication traditionally recited at times of calamity.\r\n“The prayers were conducted at all mosques ... Our sincere appeal to mankind is to stop this war,” Latheef added.\r\nSocial activist Shiraj Yoonus, who also took part in the prayers, said it was the least he could do.\r\n“The volume of destruction we see, the lives lost, the limbs lost, the injured children, pregnant women ... they have been massacred indiscriminately,” he told Arab News. “If I see this (now), then how will the Day of Judgment be?”\r\nSince the beginning of the deadly bombardment, people in predominantly Buddhist Sri Lanka have been taking to the streets almost every day to take part in interfaith rallies to demonstrate their solidarity with Palestinians.\r\nFriday’s prayers were also followed by rallies.\r\nSri Lankan parliamentarians have also shown their support; more than 150 MPs sent an open letter to the UN secretary-general this week demanding swift action to stop Israel’s war on Gaza as well as the oppression of the people of Palestine.\r\n“We are determined to continue this protest until the Israelis stop their brutality,” said Dr. Mohamed Illyas, a former legislator who took part in a rally in front of the Wekanda Mosque. “We will take this message to the head of our country to make our voice heard in all international forums.”",

        "article": "Sunak’s game plan for saving the Conservatives\r\n\r\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s main challenge is to win the next election for a divided and unpopular Conservative Party and government which had seen five prime ministers in 13 years. The latest twist in the Sunak story is that he has fired Home Secretary Suella Braverman, the provocative right-winger who is expected to contest for the party’s leadership after the election, and he has brought back former prime minister David Cameron as foreign secretary.\r\nJames Cleverly moves from being foreign secretary to home secretary. Is Sunak sending out a strong message that aggressive right-wingers have no place in his team, or it an action of a desperate man losing control over party and government? It is being said that Braverman will continue to be on the offensive outside the government, and she will strengthen her corner in the party.\r\nThe return of Cameron carries a complicated and ambiguous message. Cameron took the risk of calling for a referendum on leaving the European Union (EU), now familiar as Brexit, but he was on the losing side, those who wanted to remain with the EU. Then he resigned after the referendum results were announced. So by bringing in Cameron, Sunak seems to be conveying that there are no sharp divisions in the Conservative Party, and the moderate Cameron is indeed the need of the hour. Will this move help Sunak and the Conservatives to improve their popularity rating which is now lagging 20 per cent behind Labour? The advantage that Sunak has over Labour is that he seems to be articulate and he has a plan to move forward in contrast to Labour leader Keir Starmer, who despite his forceful criticism of Sunak, the government and the Conservatives, does not have a well laid-out programme of what he and Labour would do when they win the election.\r\nThe provocation for the sacking of Braverman was an article she wrote criticising the police for being soft on pro-Palestinian protesters – there have been large protests in London in the wake of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas – compared to its attitude towards right-wing protesters. There was an uproar in the opposition and in the media over this. It seemed bizarre that a home secretary should blame the police for bias. It is a fact that there can be no political meddling with how the police functions because it can be pulled up only when it violates the law. Braverman must have tried to rein in the police force and failed.\r\nAnd her article can be seen as an expression of her frustration that she was unable to control the police. The home secretary accusing the police for being partisan is a bad sign for the government. Braverman chose to make the criticism to make her uncompromising political position clear. Sunak had no other option but to drop her from the cabinet.\r\nThe succession of Conservative prime ministers – David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – shows an interesting phenomenon. Cameron was not a man with pronounced viewpoints. He seemed to represent the old school of privileged Conservatives. May too was the middle-of-the road leader. She like Cameron was against Brexit, but she changed her position and said that now the people have chosen to leave EU, then it is the duty of the government to implement it.\r\nJohnson jumped into the fray with more of theatrics over Brexit than any settled views. He pushed through Brexit with enthusiasm, which was mistaken for strength of leadership. Truss strode the unpopular path of giving tax concessions when the economy was in turmoil. Compared to Truss, Sunak seemed a man with clear ideas of coping with the crisis through nuanced measures. But Britain’s economic woes have not ended.",

The British Ministry of Defense announced last Saturday that it would conduct reconnaissance flights over the eastern Mediterranean, including airspace over Israel and the Gaza Strip. The aim of the flights is to provide intelligence to Tel Aviv under the pretext of supporting \"the operation to rescue detainees\" The movement called on Britain to withdraw what it described as its direct participation and political and financial support for the war of extermination against Gaza. On November 24, Hamas and Israel entered into a truce brokered by Qatar in coordination with Egypt and the United States.\n\nBritain announced its intention to fly surveillance planes over Gaza to search for detainees (Reuters)\nThe Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) condemned Britain's intention to fly surveillance planes over Gaza, considering it a direct participation in the Israeli \"genocide\" war against the Gaza Strip and the massacres committed in it.\nHamas said in a statement on Telegram on Sunday that \"Britain's disclosure of its army's intention to carry out intelligence sorties over the Gaza Strip makes it a partner with the Zionist occupation in its crimes, and responsible for the massacres to which the Palestinian people are exposed.\"\n\"London should have corrected its historical offensive stance against the Palestinian people, and atonement for the Balfour Declaration (1917), which is the sin of the century, instead of committing another sin and reminding the world of its shameful colonial past,\" the statement said.\nThe British Ministry of Defense announced last Saturday that it would conduct reconnaissance flights over the eastern Mediterranean, including airspace over Israel and the Gaza Strip, with the aim of providing intelligence to Tel Aviv under the pretext of supporting \"the operation to rescue detainees.\"\nThe ministry said in a statement on Saturday that London has been working with its partners in the region since the seventh of last October to ensure the release of detainees, including British citizens, and noted that the safety of its citizens is Britain's top priority.\nHamas said in its statement that Britain's intention to conduct \"reconnaissance flights\" over the Gaza Strip puts the British government itself in enmity with the Palestinian people and all the free people of the world who reject the Israeli aggression on Gaza.\nThe movement called on Britain to withdraw what it described as its direct participation and political and financial support for the war of extermination against Gaza, and to stop its dependence on the United States of America as well as its contribution to igniting wars, instead of contributing to peace and stability in the region.\nSince the seventh of last October, the Israeli army has launched a continuous aggression on Gaza, leaving 15,523 martyrs, 41,316 wounded, in addition to massive destruction in residential neighborhoods, vital facilities and hospitals.\nOn November 24, Hamas and Israel entered into a seven-day truce brokered by Qatar in coordination with Egypt and the United States, during which 7 Israelis who were detained in Gaza were released, compared to 80 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, before the occupation continued its aggression on the Strip.",

Exactly as from when, I don’t know. But it will be sooner rather than later,” he said.\r\nSpeaking on the communication cut-off in Gaza, Lazzarini said, “It can provoke or accelerate [the breakdown of] last remaining civil order we have in the Gaza Strip,” describing the destruction in Gaza “just staggering.”\r\n\r\nThe failure of the international community\r\nAddressing journalists in occupied al-Quds, Lazzarini voiced his disapproval last month of the international community's apparent abandonment of Gaza.\r\nThe international community “seems to have turned its back on Gaza,\" he said.\r\n\"People in Gaza are dying; they are not only dying from bombs and strikes: soon many more will die from the consequences of (the) siege imposed on the Gaza Strip,\" he said.\r\nLazzarini further mentioned that there is a severe shortage of fuel in Gaza, with a daily requirement of approximately 160,000 liters (or 42,200 gallons) to support hospitals and bakeries.",

They maneuver in all areas of incursion, directing strikes to blow up tanks and armored vehicles, attacking enemy soldiers’ fortification points in some buildings, and bombarding their gatherings with mortar shells and guided missiles, inflicting casualties and fatalities among the enemy ranks.”\r\n“The invading occupation forces will remain under the strikes of the fighters at every step they take. The penetration of vehicles under the impact of destruction and indiscriminate bombing, as well as the prolongation of the war, will incur more losses for the enemy, and the price will be steep by the will and strength of Allah,” Abu Obaida said in the statement.\r\nHe added: “We remind those who are delusional that Yitzhak Shamir once tried and vowed against our resistance, as did Rabin, who wished to wake up to find Gaza swallowed by the sea. Back then, our Brigades were just a few dozen fighters with light and individual weapons.”\r\nAbu Obaida continued: “Similarly, Sharon, promised you to end the Intifada within 100 days. All of these individuals have gone to the dustbins of history with a record filled with killing innocents. Our resistance remained, grew, and became greater. You, the killers, will not be luckier than them and will only achieve disappointment and downfall, by the will of Allah Almighty.”\r\nHe affirmed that “their absolute trust in the victory of Allah, the justice of our fight, and the sanctity of our battle, which is the mother of all battles, does not exempt every individual and group in our great nation from their duty towards Palestine and its cause. It is a trust in the necks of all Arabs, Muslims, and free people in the world.”\r\n“The hysteria that the occupation and its leaders are living in, fearing the movement of the resistance forces in our nation and its free people and its wide masses, is proof that this is the terrifying nightmare for the enemy. Let the enemy find you [our nation] where he fears,” he said.\r\nHe addressed the people of the whole world saying, “To all the free people of the world, we are watching your actions and see their great impact and how they cause confusion for the aggressing Zionists.”\r\nAbu Obaida warned the enemy and all those concerned with the affairs of prisoners and detainees that the continuation of aerial and ground aggression undoubtedly endangers the lives of these prisoners every hour. “Those forewarned have no excuse.”\r\nThe spokesman Abu Obaida concluded his statement by saying, “to our people, our martyrs who ascend every hour in Gaza will be immortalized in history as the greatest martyrs in the holiest of battles and under the purest banners fought in this time. Blessed are our people and our fighters for this immense honor. Shame and disgrace shall befall every onlooker to our people’s sufferings. Nothing will prevail in the kingdom of Allah except what Allah wills, and the faith of our people and their messages from beneath the rubble are the greatest testament to their greatness, pride, and their deserved honor in defending the Prophet’s path [Al-Aqsa] and their bond in the blessed holy land.”",

This is not evacuation but expulsion under the threat of arms.\"\r\n\"There is a catastrophe unfolding in hospitals, with patients now dying without receiving their treatments, such as children and adults with kidney failure who are perishing at home without undergoing dialysis sessions,\" stated Minister Alkaila.\r\nThe Health Minister confirmed the tragic death of 12 patients, including two newborns, inside Al-Shifa Medical Complex so far as a result of power outages and shortages of medical supplies.\r\nShe highlighted that all 3,000 cancer patients who were receiving treatment at Rantisi and Turkish hospitals have been abandoned to face imminent death following their forced eviction from these hospitals by the Israeli occupation forces.\r\n\"All pregnant women, especially those with high-risk pregnancies, are now in imminent danger as they cannot find anyone to provide them with medical care and services in Gaza. Every woman about to give birth will find no medical assistance,\" warned Minister Alkaila.\r\nShe further explained that patients and the wounded are unable to reach Al-Shifa Medical Complex, resulting in many losing their lives either while bleeding or due to the lack of essential medications and necessary treatments.\r\nAlkaila highlighted the critical situation inside Al-Shifa Complex, where medical teams are unable to move between sections and buildings due to constant drone fire threatening anyone within the complex.\r\n\"Another danger threatening patients' lives is the inability of medical teams to bury 100 martyrs, whose bodies have started to decompose in the hospital courtyard. Stray dogs have reportedly attacked some of the bodies, and medical waste is piling up inside the hospital,\" she added.\r\nAlkaila continued, \"Patients are getting injured again while they are in the hospital beds as a result of the occupation's shelling of the medical complex. This shelling has affected water wells, oxygen stations, the main gate to the complex, and other facilities.\"\r\nShe pointed out that the wounded, patients, and medical teams not only lack proper medical care but also have nothing to eat. Additionally, water is cut off from the complex.\r\nShe emphasized that the solution now lies in supplying the medical complex with electricity, medical supplies, medications, and fuel. Otherwise, a safe evacuation of patients for treatment in Egypt is necessary, as hospitals in Gaza can no longer accommodate more wounded individuals.",

This has resulted in the failure to realize the Palestinian people’s desire to build an independent state and the sustained historical inequity they are facing.\nThe U.S. is blaming the Middle East crisis onto Palestine while branding it an \"aggressor\", but the fair international community is categorically rejecting this.\nForeign ministers of the Arab League member states held an emergency meeting in Cairo on Oct. 11, at which they strongly urged Israel to return to the negotiations for the \"two-state plan\" to provide a state where the Palestinian people can live, contending that peace in the Middle East would be impossible without an independent Palestinian state.\nWorld public warns that the stability and security on the earth are being threatened due to the arbitrary and double-standard foreign policy of the U.S.\nThe international community should closely watch the U.S. moves and resolutely denounce and reject the dangerous and foolish attempt.",

The move prompted uproar among journalists at NBC News and sister network MSNBC, many of whom have slammed the decision on air, pointing to her role in spreading former President Donald Trump’s dangerous lies.\r\n“She was not hired by MSNBC,” O’Donnell said. “I stopped inviting Trump liars like her on this program in 2016, because I’ve never seen a satisfying, successful interview of a Trump liar and have never thought that I alone could crack the code of how to interview a Trump liar. They are fast and furious liars, and I doubt that I could keep up.”\r\nO’Donnell said he would never interview McDaniel as an expert on Republican campaigns.\r\n“MSNBC will not use Ronna McDaniel as a political analyst, but I do have a few questions for her whenever she might want to come on this program,” he said. “And I’ll make it easy for her. I’ll tell her the questions ahead of time.”\r\n“My first question would be: Why did you change your name for Donald Trump?” he continued.\r\nMcDaniel used to go by Ronna Romney McDaniel. Trump reportedly asked her to stop using her middle name publicly in 2017 before she stepped into her RNC role, amid a deepening feud with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who had been a critic of Trump’s presidential campaign.\r\nRomney is McDaniel’s uncle.\r\n“How does that feel? To change your name to curry favor with a madman because he doesn’t like your uncle. How did you explain that to your kids?” O’Donnell asked.\r\nHe said he would also ask her about “everything she did to try to help Donald Trump overthrow the election that she yesterday decided to say for the very first time, four years late, that Joe Biden won fair and square.”\r\nAccording to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, MSNBC leadership initially raised no objections to hiring McDaniel, but changed course after staff voiced concerns.",

The GBTUB also has a page featuring the chorus of Lee Greenwood’s patriotic standard, “God Bless the USA,” in the singer’s handwriting.\r\nTrump really pushed the Bible in a three-minute video that Mediaite described as “utterly bonkers.”\r\nSome of the choicer bits ...\r\n“And this is very important and very important to me. I want to have a lot of people have it. You have to have it for your heart, for your soul. Many of you have never read them and don’t know the liberties and rights you have as Americans, and how you are being threatened to lose those rights; it’s happening all the time.\r\n“It’s a very sad thing that’s going on in our country, but we’re going to get it turned around. Religion and Christianity are the biggest things missing from this country, and I truly believe that we need to bring them back here and we have to bring them back fast. I think it’s one of the biggest problems we have.”\r\nIn the video, Trump suggests he’s more religious than he actually is and suggests he’s quite familiar with the Bible, despite evidence that he’s not.\r\n“All Americans need a Bible in their home and I have many, it’s my favorite book, it’s a lot of people’s favorite book. This Bible is a reminder that the biggest thing we have to bring back America and to make America great again is our religion.\r\n“Religion is so important, it’s so missing. But it’s going to come back and it’s going to come back strong, just like our country is going to come back strong.”\r\nThe FAQ page on the website notes that it is the only Bible endorsed by Donald Trump but that the company “is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign.”\r\nThe website also notes that the product is “not political” or part of any campaign, but it does include information on the company’s licensing deal with Trump, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, that suggests the deal benefits him personally.\r\nHuffPost reached out to Greenwood to see if he was a partner in the product or just licensed his name and song as well. No one immediately responded.\r\nHowever, the singer did post Trump’s video endorsement on X.\r\nThe reaction among users of X, formerly Twitter, can be summed up in three short sentences: Oh. My. God.\r\nOne person posted a video reminding people of the depth ― or lack thereof ― of Trump’s biblical knowledge.\r\nOne person was sure it wouldn’t end well.\r\nBut one person also noted that the Trump-endorsed Bible seemed more about worshipping him than Jesus Christ.",

It was a brilliant idea. She would have or could have spilled the beans on the fake electors and the alternate slates and so forth and so on. Instead, you had this cabal of aging superstars at the network who insisted that this person was somehow inappropriate. Says who and according to whom?”\r\nHe said, “It really is outrageous. This is censorship!”\r\nRivera, a former Fox News personality and reporter who also worked at ABC News and had a long talk show stint, previously expressed hope that McDaniel would sue NBC.\r\nFast-forward to 2:25:\r\nNBC announced McDaniel’s hiring as a contributor on Friday and she made her debut Sunday on “Meet the Press.” She was grilled by host Kristen Welker over her repeated defenses of Trump’s big lie, and former “MTP” host Todd followed by questioning NBC’s decision to bring her aboard. It would be McDaniel’s only appearance before the network axed her.",

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who had served as vice chair of the House panel, responded to Trump on X at the time.\r\n“Hi Donald: You know these are lies,” she wrote. “You’re trying to halt your 1/6 trial because your VP, WH counsel, WH aides, campaign & DOJ officials etc will testify against you. You’re afraid of the truth and you should be.”\r\nNearly 1,400 people have been charged in relation to the Capitol breach, including almost 490 charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Justice Department. The investigation is still ongoing.\r\nTrump has been criminally indicted twice in connection to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\r\nHe wrote earlier this month that one of his first priorities if elected again will be to “Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned.”",

        "article": "Social Media Accounts Spew Conspiracy Theories About Key Bridge Collapse\r\n\r\nRight-wing influencers on X used the tragedy in Baltimore to boost their brands.\r\n\r\nSocial media accounts were serving up conspiracy theories within hours of a container ship knocking down the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on Tuesday.\r\nFederal and local law enforcement said they suspected no foul play, but several people on X, the former Twitter, claimed that the incident looked deliberate, and that it may have been orchestrated by terrorists or shadowy foreign actors.\r\n“There should be a serious investigation into the horrifying tragedy of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland. Is this an intentional attack or an accident?” far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) pondered in a post on X — the latest in a long list of conspiracy theories she’s helped push into the mainstream.\r\nSome accounts suggested that Israel directed the freighter to strike the bridge as retaliation for the U.S. allowing the United Nations to adopt a resolution calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\r\nOther accounts mused that the shipping company must have adopted “diversity, equity and inclusion” policies that lowered hiring standards and resulted in less-qualified staff piloting the ship.\r\nThere’s no evidence for the DEI theory, but it’s a concept that X owner Elon Musk has himself promoted, baselessly, as an explanation for recent air travel safety snafus.\r\nAnd Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist best known for defaming the grieving parents of children who were murdered in school shootings, said the bridge collapse “looks deliberate.”\r\n“A cyber-attack is probable,” Jones proclaimed on X, the platform where Musk restored his account in December after Jones had been banned for almost five years. “WW3 has already started.”\r\nAndrew Tate, the social media personality who is facing rape and human trafficking charges in Romania, joined Jones in peddling the “cyber-attack” theory.\r\n“Lights go off and it deliberately steers towards the bridge supports,” Tate wrote on X. “Foreign agents of the USA attack digital infrastructures. Nothing is safe. Black Swan event imminent.”\r\nConservative talking heads were quick to hop on the bandwagon, working to connect the incident to everything from clean energy investments and President Joe Biden’s border policies to the lingering impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns.\r\n“You look at our critical infrastructure, and I’m one of these people that believes we’ve never fully come out of all the lockdowns and the COVID issues,” Matt Schlapp, the head of the Conservative Political Action Committee, said on the right-wing Newsmax. “I’m no expert on what’s going on on the seas, but all I would say is that if you talk to employers in America, they’ll tell you that filling slots with employees who aren’t drug-addled is a very huge problem.”\r\nIn an interview with Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Tuesday morning, Fox News host Maria Bartiromo cited a statement from the White House that there is no evidence the incident was deliberate. She then applauded Scott for “talking a lot about the potential for wrongdoing, or potential for foul play, given the wide-open border.” (Bartiromo was presumably referring to the U.S.-Mexico border, which is, at best, some 1,500 miles from Baltimore, and is not “wide open.”)\r\nIn an interview with Newsmax, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) blamed Biden’s climate and clean energy investments for America’s aging infrastructure.\r\n“We’re not spending it on roads and bridges,” Mace said of recent infrastructure funding. “Look at the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that was done a couple years ago that the left hails as this massive success, but it was mostly Green New Deal [spending] actually in that bill.”\r\nThat bill passed in 2021 with bipartisan support.\r\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said the container ship issued a distress call and lost power shortly before it struck the bridge. Moore said a preliminary investigation indicated the collision was an accident and that there was no reason to suspect terrorism.\r\n“There is no specific and credible information to suggest any ties to terrorism at this time,” the FBI’s Baltimore field office said on X. “The investigation is ongoing.”",

        "article": "The Fight for Reparations Cannot Ignore Climate Change\n\nRacial redress should be modeled on the global anticolonial tradition of worldbuilding.\n\nReparations have seen a resurgence of interest in recent years, stemming from a variety of sources. Perhaps most familiarly, Ta-Nehisi Coates’s influential 2014 essay in the Atlantic, “The Case for Reparations,” set off a firestorm of reactions across the political spectrum, culminating years later in a “historic” Congressional hearing in 2019. In the wake of George Floyd’s murder and the rebellions of 2020, reparations programs task forces have launched in the city of Detroit and state of California while a housing payment program launched in Evanston. And last year, House Resolution 40—introduced every year in Congress since John Conyers Jr. first introduced it in 1989, and calling for a commission to study reparations for slavery—finally passed through the Judiciary Committee for full consideration on the House floor.\nBut what exactly does the call for reparations demand, and what kind of political movement does it entail? The label has been applied to a vast array of different programs and policies, from direct cash payments to African Americans to symbolic apologies, creations of museums and sites of spiritual recognition, and academic studies about the nature of systemic racism. In a 2016 essay, political scientist Adolph Reed, Jr., took aim at this feature of the call for reparations, describing it as a blend of “material, symbolic, and psychological components.” Reed thinks this ambiguity is a liability, since elites can exploit the demand by choosing the version of reparations that is cheapest for them: the symbolic. More important, Reed contends, overinvestment in symbolic reparations could detract energy and resources from an alternative, preferable political project: “building broad solidarity across race, gender, and other identities around shared concerns of daily life” like “access to quality health care, the right to a decent and dignified livelihood, affordable housing, quality education for all.” Reed thus warns that the call for reparations for some distracts from a more worthy political project that would provide justice for all—an objection also voiced during the 2019 House hearing.\nBut what if the project for reparations was the project for “safer neighborhoods and better schools,” for a “less punitive justice system,” for “the right to a decent and dignified livelihood”? Responding to Reed in Dissent in 2019, African American studies scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor pointed out that the struggle to build a just social system can’t be won solely through “universal” programs addressing common problems. Taylor gives the example of the large disparity rate in maternal mortality between Black mothers and white mothers: the accumulated history of disparate and discriminatory treatment and policy means that not all of the relevant social problems are, in fact, common to both. To build a just health care system, we would have to address both lack of access due to unjust economic structures and lack of access due to unfair gender- and race-based discrimination. From the point of view of building a just health care system, these goals aren’t substitutes for each other; they are complementary.\nThough it is less well elaborated in today’s popular debates, this understanding of reparations—one that sees it as central to the expansive project of building a more just world, not just as a material or symbolic mechanism of redress for past harms—has a long legacy. This vision is worth recovering and integrating with other important political movements today, above all the global struggle for climate justice.\nThere is ample footing, both in theory and in practice, for widening the scope of our conversations about reparations in this way. In his historical study of the Black radical imagination, Freedom Dreams (2002), historian Robin D. G. Kelley notes that the demand for reparations “was never entirely, or even primarily, about money.” Instead, it was about social justice, reconciliation, reconstructing the internal life of black America, and eliminating institutional racism. This is why reparations proposals from black radical movements focus less on individual payments than on securing funds to build autonomous black institutions, improving community life, and in some cases establishing a homeland that will enable African Americans to develop a political economy geared more toward collective needs than toward accumulation.\nThis view—constructive in outlook and global in ambition—has a particularly useful antecedent in midcentury struggles for independence. As historian Adom Getachew shows in her recent book Worldmaking after Empire: The Rise and Fall of Self-Determination (2019), the wave of decolonization movements that crested toward the end of World War II forced new political questions onto the world stage. Prominent figures in the growing global anticolonial movement demanded the institutionalization of self-determination as a political principle of the United Nations, worked to form regional political blocs for mutual aid and uplift, and demanded a New International Economic Order with a different set of rules than the set that had emerged from the interaction of colonial domination and the capitalist economy that emerged from it: what I call “global racial empire.” They imagined new institutions, different relationships between countries, and also, crucially, the most recognizable aspect of reparations politics: redistribution of global wealth, from the First World (back) to the Third World.\nThese activists weren’t just fighting against the structures of colonial domination and racial apartheid; they were also trying to build a more just world on a planetary scale. Unfortunately, they did not succeed: the end of the Cold War, the disciplining of the newly independent states, and the corresponding defeat of radical politics around the globe produced struggles for justice that often set their sights much lower. But any politically serious reparations project—at least one fitting the goals and ethos of the constructive view—should build on this long and worthy tradition of “worldmaking.” It must include two elements, in particular.\nFirst, it must be global in scope. This is not to deny the importance of national or regional struggles for reparations, from the United States to Caribbean nations’ CARICOM Reparations Commission, reparations projects formed on the African continent, and demands from Indigenous groups who have collaborated across their nations to push for redress of grievances. But slavery, colonialism, and the political structure they produced are global phenomena, and we need a global theoretical perspective on what could (and does) unite these separate political projects.\nSecond, and perhaps less obviously, a politically serious reparations project must focus on climate change. The connection between climate crisis, slavery, and colonialism flows from distributions of wealth and vulnerability created by centuries of global politics and its ecological consequences, layered with more recent histories of pollution in the Global North and corporate fossil fuel interests. As climate impacts accelerate, we can expect their burdens to fall disproportionately on those who have been rendered most vulnerable through the accumulated weight of such histories. Our response to climate crisis thus deeply constrains the possibilities for justice.\nThe historical connections between the climate crisis and our present systems of injustice help explain why a just future depends on reparations. Before the rise of global racial empire, different regions of the globe evolved in a fair degree of ecological isolation: ecological connections were constrained by the size and scope of relatively local human economic trade. The newly formed global racial empire exploded in the 1500s and stretched that trade across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, comprising what some scholars call the “Columbian exchange”: a historically unprecedented flow of plants, animals, and pathogens into environments that had never dealt with them before. The results were immediate and world-changing. The introduction of European pathogens alongside forms of colonial domination, especially the extensive slave trade in Indigenous populations, led to 56 million deaths in the Americas over the sixteenth century—so many that some scientists estimate that this “Great Dying” cooled the Earth. This was the first anthropogenic global climate event, setting the political stage for the Industrial Revolution. In addition to the unfathomable suffering and loss of life, this catastrophic depopulation of the Americas likely enabled the success of the European campaigns of imperial conquest.\nWhen the Industrial Revolution followed centuries later, human production for the first time outpaced the natural constraints on growth. The British empire, where this process started, was already dominating key parts of the world, including much of the Indian subcontinent. These regimes of exploitation coincided with a crucial bit of geological luck: England had more available coal on its islands than competitors in Europe or South Asia. British industrialists developed techniques to extract and use coal energy to compete with the Indian producers, which lead to new forms of iron production and thus mechanization, crucially in the textile industry that converted cotton from the American South into clothing for the entire world. Coal-powered, mechanized production revolutionized British manufacture and the economic world, helping to complete its dominance as a colonial power. And this aspect of the global racial empire—industrialism—would transform the ecological world.\nAlthough coal was overtaken by oil after the 1950s, the use of oil, coal, and other fossil fuels since the onset of the Industrial Revolution has sent billions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The ecological ramifications of these carbon emissions are tremendous. If present trends continue, an estimated one in three humans will—as soon as 2070—be pushed out of the climate niche that our species has inhabited for millennia. In the Global South, sea level rise poses existential threat to the Pacific islands, Bangladesh, and the Nile delta, while drought and agricultural failure leave sub-Saharan Africa on a knife’s edge.\nTo be sure, some aspects of the distribution of climate impacts are purely geographical. Whether or not a family is affected by a hurricane or sea-level rise, for example, depends on how close they live to the ocean. But what matters for our commitment to justice is how these ecological phenomena affect people’s capabilities—the lives that they are or are not empowered to live. In some cases, these geographical variables are themselves deeply shaped by centuries of injustice rather than by personal choices. In other cases, differential distributions of wealth and power today will only exacerbate inequality in the future. Some people who retreat from a coastline will have access to money or credit to manage the financial costs of relocation, a passport or citizenship status that will widen their legal relocation options, and a social status that will make their new communities likely to welcome them. Many others will lack some or all of these advantages: they will be cash-poor and indebted, have a citizenship status that radically curtails their mobility, or a social status that draws stigma and violence. These outcomes aren’t purely geographical; they are shaped by our social and political arrangements.\nWe know that the costs and burdens of environmental catastrophe will be distributed in ways that echo the history of global racial empire because it is already happening. Researchers studying New York City have found that heatwave deaths and even the temperature itself was racially distributed: residents in areas with a larger proportion of white people were wealthier and benefited from the natural cooling of more vegetation as well as the artificial cooling of air conditioners. Meanwhile, what scientists call the “urban heat island effect” put inner-city residents at risk.\nClimate crisis is also likely to lead to new social divisions between those advantaged enough to buy or coerce security from climate impacts and those who cannot. Researchers link recent violence between neighbors in Mali and Nigeria to resource conflicts exacerbated by climate-related desertification and other impacts. At a community, local, and national scale, we can expect police to protect the rich and socially well-positioned, often leaving vulnerable those on the business end of nightsticks or behind cell walls. We can also expect the balance of power between nation states and Indigenous communities to be shaped increasingly by forces of the same kind: the climate crisis is likely to shuffle increasing power and control into the hands of those in command of wealth, coercive force, or strategic resources.\nPutting all this together, the lesson is clear: to understand how the climate crisis will interact with global racial empire’s distribution of advantages and disadvantages, we need to explore the distribution of specifically environmental risk and vulnerability. Various contested economic theories suggest mechanisms for why vulnerabilities are high in the formerly colonized parts of the world, but the distribution of environmental risk and vulnerability can be explained simply in terms of patterns of accumulation.\nAccumulation is the result of distribution over time. If you and I both save ten cents of every dollar we earn over our working lives, we will both end up with accumulated savings by the time we retire. At small scales, the element of choice and responsibility matter: if we both make around the same amount of money from our jobs and have access to similarly consistent hours, then in the end the person with the most retirement funds will be the thriftiest or hardest working of the two of us. However, if I make minimum wage and you make seven figures a year, spending habits or willingness to tack on overtime shifts can never explain the difference between our retirement savings. The distribution of income in our working years, not our work habits, explains the different levels of accumulation we have when we retire. What we can do in our retirement age, how we are cared for, and what we leave to our heirs, likewise, are primarily determined by this distribution. The environmental risk and vulnerability facing countries and populations today emerges from several overlapping strands of political, cultural, and economic accumulation, which were largely set in motion generations ago.\nIn 2005, climate change researchers at the University of East Anglia created an index of eleven key indicators for vulnerability to climate change impacts: percentage of the population with access to sanitation, three measures of literacy rate (by different age groups and by gender), maternal mortality rate, typical caloric intake, civil liberties, political rights, government effectiveness, life expectancy at birth, and a measure of access to justice termed “voice and accountability.”\nSuch measures of climate vulnerability are a useful tool for the constructive view of reparations: what matters about the economy are the actual lives people are empowered to lead. And the measures clearly reveal that the colonizing parts of the world are now much less vulnerable to climate change than the regions they colonized. The measures thus reflect a simple lesson about how yesterday’s distribution affects tomorrow’s reality: heightened vulnerability to the incoming aspects of climate change correlates directly with greater deprivation in the status quo. In short, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It is not that every aspect of today’s global racial empire is rooted in the impacts of climate change—but every aspect of tomorrow’s global racial empire will be. Climate change will redistribute social advantages in a way that compounds and locks in the distributional injustices we have inherited from history.\nIn the face of these links, what should be done? We don’t have to agree on every aspect of the new world we are building to agree on ways to improve the justice of our current arrangements. At the same time, even in times of immense political opportunity, the possibilities for change are profoundly constrained by the balance of power we inherit from centuries past. As Frederick Douglass noted, “power concedes nothing without a demand.” It is thus imperative to issue clear demands. Here are some places we might start.\n\nUnconditional Cash Transfers\nContemporary demands for reparations have rightly kept focus on this tactic. In stark contrast to the byzantine social support systems that have come to characterize modern social democracies, social scientists are beginning to embrace “unconditional cash transfers”—simply giving people money directly. These kinds of transfers will intervene directly in the patterns of accumulation, one of our most adaptable forms of social advantages. It also avoids the problems with other welfare programs: the sprawling (and questionably efficacious) overhead, the paternalistic attempts to further shape people’s incentives, and the “poverty traps” caused by aid withdrawal once a recipient crosses some threshold of income or welfare. Furthermore, the ethos of the unconditional cash transfer matches self-determination as a goal for reparations policies, which is part and parcel of the constructive view.\nIn their recent book From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century (2020), economist William A. Darity, Jr., and scholar A. Kirsten Mullen endorse a strategy rooted in direct payments to African Americans descended from those enslaved in the United States, disbursed over time rather than all at once (to prevent inflation) and via trust funds and endowments. Moreover, it would be governed by a National Reparations Board that enlists its recipients in research about and decisions over the funds, further bolstering a commitment to an outcome of self-determination. Scholar and organizer Dorian Warren of the Economic Security Project has suggested that we adopt a strategy rooted in “targeted universalism”—a universal basic income for all, plus an additional amount for African Americans to account for the owed reparations. These proposals have been discussed in the context of U.S. politics, but others have suggested a global universal basic income, which could be weighted in the targeted way that Warren suggests. Both of these are exactly the kind of demands we should want to win.\n\nGlobal Climate Funding\nCash transfers directly redistribute social advantages in a powerful way, but they do not directly redistribute disadvantages: including the vulnerability to environmental harm and the burden of climate policy.\nThe Climate Equity Reference Frame is an effort-sharing framework that calculates “fair shares” of the global climate transition effort to individual countries based on their “responsibility” for global emissions and capacity to mobilize resources for reductions in greenhouse emissions given its economic and development needs. Across a variety of ways of calculating “fair share,” poorer countries pledged emissions reductions that greatly exceed their share of climate work while rich counties pledged far less than their share. In fact, poor countries have pledged 50 percent more in reductions than rich countries.\nPart of the reason that richer countries’ reduction pledges lag behind their fair share is because achieving the needed scale of change in a reasonable time frame is technologically difficult. Another approach would be for a richer country to bear the costs of reducing emissions where there are more opportunities for faster emissions reduction.\nThe Green Climate Fund, managed under the existing United Nations Framework on Climate Change, could facilitate such inter-country transfers and provide other support. The rich nations and associated institutions have pledged to raise $100 billion for developing nations’ green development, a step in the right direction. However, Dr. Mariama Williams of the South Centre, an intergovernmental organization supported and staffed by developing countries, claims that this “does not even come close” to what is needed to make significant inroads into the climate crisis. Moreover, the rich countries have failed to follow through on their pledges; the fund stood at a fraction of its goal in early 2020. Both the funding target and the follow-through by richer countries must increase substantially.\nFunding the technology to reduce emissions is crucial, but how do we pay for crises and impacts when they arrive? The United Nations and other intergovernmental organization typically refer to crises—such as those stemming from natural disasters like hurricanes—as “loss and damage.” The question of who should pay for the loss and damage of climate change raises familiar problems in distributive justice: Should rich countries pay because they are richer or because they have emitted more? We can add another: or because they’ve inherited more of the liabilities from global racial empire?\nNo matter how we settle this issue, today’s mechanisms for loss and damage funding shows us what to avoid. Beyond the problem of consistent underfunding, the substantial flow of loans to Third World countries in crisis saddles recipients with debt rather than relief. Debt jubilee could free up vast amounts of public spending in Third World countries toward increasing climate security. Failing that, debt relief for climate finance swaps could reverse this: converting sovereign debt into fuel for climate relief for Third World nations whose money is better spent on climate adaptation than debt service.\n\nTorch the Tax Havens\nFinancing the proposals above will require revamping the financial system locally and globally to prevent elites from hiding and hoarding the world’s wealth, and a crucial component of such a program must involve confronting “tax havens”—sites for the accumulation of wealth, often ill-gotten, which shield wealth holders from taxes. In his book The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Heavens (2015), economist Gabriel Zucman estimates that at least $7.6 trillion of the world’s wealth was held in these offshore accounts. This is surely a low-ball estimate, Zucman notes, since his calculation excludes wealth tied up in real assets (e.g., yachts, jewelry) and circulating in cash, where much of the wealth from drug and other illegal trades is stored. To understand the scale of this mammoth figure, consider that in 2019, the budget for United States’ entire military apparatus—including the Department of Defense, all 17 of its intelligence agencies, its war budget for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, its nuclear weapons program, and veterans affairs expenses—was estimated at $1.25 trillion, less than a fifth of the value of the wealth horded in the world’s tax havens.\nWhile tax havens appear in both the Global North and Global South (Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, and Ireland, Panama), the overall effect of their distribution has worked out to impoverish Global South countries. Zucman estimates that at least 22 percent of Latin American wealth and 30 percent of African wealth is held offshore, representing tens of billions of dollars of lost tax revenue that could be put to the service of crucial green infrastructure development, just housing, or other pivotal worldbuilding uses. As one advocate of greater control over financial flows reminds us: “For every country losing money illicitly, there is another country absorbing it. Illicit financial outflows are facilitated by financial opacity in tax havens and in Western economies like the United States.” Implementing transparency measures to curtail tax haven secrecy and anonymous shell companies is crucial to curtailing illicit flows.\n\nDivest-Invest, from Fossil Fuels to Communities\nFossil fuel divestment campaigns often aim to move capital from problematic fossil fuel corporations to more “climate responsible investments.” On the view of climate justice developed here, green investments in Black and Indigenous communities are climate- responsible investments. We ought to think of fossil fuel companies like we think of police, as generators of insecurity, and make similar efforts to divert resources from them back into looted communities. The divest–invest framework in both of these divestment campaigns ought to aim for this same pattern of redistribution.\nSome might be skeptical: divestment campaigns don’t seem to work. . . . until they do. When they reach a tipping “threshold,” they can have sudden and dramatic effects. Each institution that divests poses limited financial risks for investors, but each additional divesting corporation increases the difficult-to-quantify reputational risks that could trigger wider scale (and more consequential) market movement. A group consisting of fewer than ten percent of investors, according to simulations, could trigger a systemwide redistribution of social resources away from fossil fuels.\nSocial movements can also be “tipped” in this way. In 2014 youth runners went on hundred- or even thousand-mile runs, spreading news of an incoming pipeline by word of mouth. Hundreds, then thousands, answered the call and camped around the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to defend the Indigenous territory from the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline being attempted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Standing Rock was one battle in a larger confrontation; similar campaigns were being waged at the same time and continue around the world now—from residents in Appalachia opposing Dominion Energy’s pipelines through their communities to the Kenyan environmental activists mobilized against construction of a Chinese-financed coal-fired energy plant on the island of Lamu.\nAnyone within a stone’s throw of an institution that is invested in fossil fuels—a state or national government, a university, even a company—can start or join a divestment movement, or oppose the construction or expansion of environmentally and socially harmful production. You can also demand that the divested social resources be invested in and by Black, Indigenous, and other colonized communities.\n\nDeciding Together\nA question that is equally pressing for grassroots struggle and the formal halls of power is how to debate, prioritize, and act on these and other proposals. In much of the world today, representative democracy is plagued by elite capture: the manipulation of public institutions and resources by the most advantaged and well-positioned, often to the detriment of everyone else. As if that’s not bad enough, many of the approaches to combating this very kind of injustice, including valorization of and organizing around marginalized identities, are likewise vulnerable to elite capture.\nA better alternative than reliance on representative institutions is to emphasize the distribution of power itself. Energy researcher Johanna Bozuwa provides a helpful example in her summary of the work of many activists and community organizations, which she calls “energy democracy.” Community control over the generation, transportation, and distribution of energy would shift the incentives governing how those important social advantages—as well as the associated disadvantages, such as pollution—are controlled and managed. Publicly owned utilities are no radical pipedream, even in the United States: they already serve small cities like Hammond, Wisconsin, and big ones like Los Angeles, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. But beyond public ownership of energy, protection from elite capture is key to the pursuit of climate justice. Community-level decision making and control of public utilities must be the goal.\nIt is not enough to say that we should listen to the voices of marginalized peoples in making decisions and controlling climate initiatives. Each of us will have to decide, after all, which specific perspectives of many we want to support. We shouldn’t expect that process to be easy or without controversy. Groups including Indigenous-led Red Nation, Cooperation Jackson in predominantly Black Mississippi, and the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance have each issued carefully developed statements offering broad direction as to what climate justice looks like in action. But the devil is often in the details.\nIdentity issues further complicate an equally fundamental problem: the formal structures we have to work with are not well suited to respond to global problems. Environmental policy professor Michael Méndez details how a policy proposal for California to purchase “carbon offsets” split Indigenous groups in Brazil, with representatives from larger groups with legally recognized land like the Yawanawa speaking in favor of the proposal, and representatives from forest communities like the Apurina and Jaminawa speaking against. Whatever decisions lawmakers make, none of these people, who live in Brazil, voted for the California legislators, and none of them are in a position to vote them out. As Méndez argues, we may need new “trans-local” ways of acting and thinking across largely different geographic and political contexts, ways that emphasize the importance of community-level decision making and impacts.\n\nSome might worry about the scope of this constructive view of reparations. They might think that a global focus on reparations as “worldmaking,” linked with international struggles against climate injustice, could distract from more specific campaigns. But it is no coincidence that the civil rights movement and the decolonization of more than 100 nations all occurred simultaneously in the decades following World War II: each of these struggles made the others more likely to succeed, not less. Attempting to prevent rather than join up with other group’s efforts stems from understandable motivations but is ultimately self-defeating.\nOthers could worry about the content of a constructive reparations program rather than its scope: that such a way of thinking about reparations will distract us from bread-and-butter reparations demands, like direct transfers of money to individuals and families or reconciliation processes. But this worry is misguided. The constructive view is all-encompassing: it would unequivocally support cash transfers to African Americans, for example, and reforms to education to facilitate more honest teaching and relationships around the history of slavery and colonialism. The constructive view is not a replacement for these, but a particular understanding of what they aim to accomplish: changing our social environment for the better. This framework simply identifies opportunities for reconstruction that include and go beyond these, linking the important need for cash and memorials to equally important issues, from addressing the destructive role of prisons and pollutants to building food and energy systems that protect us all. And indeed, in a world increasingly ravaged by climate catastrophe, the time is long overdue to forge a political movement equal to the scope of that planetary challenge. The colonizers of the world have never been confused about the scale of their ambitions; it is time they met their match.",

Huffman alleged in the suit that Schlapp had “groped” and “fondled” his groin without consent after an event in Atlanta in late 2022 while the pair were trying to get the former football star elected to Congress.\r\nThe suit demanded $9.4 million in damages for sexual battery and defamation. But Huffman dropped the case and apologized to the powerful Republican couple on Tuesday, with his lawyer telling Politico the trio had “resolved their differences.”\r\n“I am discontinuing all of my lawsuits,” Huffman said in a statement through his attorneys. “The claims made in my lawsuits were the result of a complete misunderstanding, and I regret that the lawsuit caused pain to the Schlapp family.”\r\n“The Schlapps have advised that the statements made about me were the result of a misunderstanding, which was regrettable,” he continued, referencing his claims the couple had defamed him. “Neither the Schlapps nor the [American Conservative Union] paid me anything to dismiss my claims against them.”\r\nSchlapp re-asserted his innocence in a statement later Tuesday, saying his family had been “attacked by a left-wing media that is focused on the destruction of conservatives regardless of the truth and the facts.”\r\n“We also learned that the left is waging a relentless war against those of us who still hold fast to the principles of America’s founding and the liberty that has endured throughout our 248-year history,” Schlapp wrote on Twitter. “Going forward, our eyes are wide open, we understand the struggle better and we learned we must stand our ground and fight or else the haters on the left will destroy every conservative and ultimately our nation.”\r\nSchlapp is a close ally of former President Donald Trump and also heads the American Conservative Union. His wife worked in the Trump administration and for was an aide on his failed 2020 bid for office.\r\nA separate defamation lawsuit filed against Republican activist Caroline Wren after Huffman went forward with his allegations was also ended this week.",

Don’t watch football. Don’t eat hamburgers. This is not good for you.’ The message is too feminine: ‘Everything you’re doing is destroying the planet. You’ve got to eat your peas.’”\r\n“If you listen to Democratic elites — NPR is my go-to place for that — the whole talk is about how women, and women of color, are going to decide this election,” Carville continued. “I’m like: ‘Well, 48% of the people that vote are males. Do you mind if they have some consideration?’”\r\nLast week, CNN published new polling indicating that support for Biden among voters of color has reached a historic low in the swing state of Michigan, following a pattern in other states of diminished minority backing.\r\nA Gallup poll in February indicated that Democrats’ status as the party of preference among Black voters has been reduced by almost 20 points in the last three years.\r\nCarville, who famously counseled former President Bill Clinton to victory in 1992, did not specifically identify any of the women he deemed “preachy,” but one of the party’s more outspoken progressive lawmakers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), clapped back.\r\n“Maybe he should start a podcast about it,” she wrote on X. “I hear men are really underrepresented in that space.”",

They stole it. And they hate when we say this. They stole it. And they’re on notice; they’re not going to be able to steal it again. People are doing a ton of work on this, and that’s still not enough, but it’s going to get better. The hairy eyeball is going to be on them.”\r\nBannon continued, “The only way that they defeat Trump is to steal it. The only way they defeat Trump is they steal it. The only way they defeat Trump is they steal it. He is unstoppable. ”\r\nIt should be noted that a study released in 2023 found that Bannon’s podcast “was crowned the top peddler of false, misleading and unsubstantiated statements among political podcasts,” The New York Times wrote.\r\nWhile he clings to his baseless assertion, Bannon also faces legal jeopardy related to the effort to overturn the 2020 election.\r\nBannon was given four months behind bars for defying a subpoena to surrender relevant records to a House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, but has appealed.",

        "article": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Taps Attorney Nicole Shanahan As Running Mate\r\n\r\nShanahan, a wealthy Kennedy backer, shares the independent presidential candidate's concerns about the environment and his skepticism of vaccine safety.\r\n\r\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday that he had selected wealthy Bay Area attorney and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan as his vice-presidential running mate.\r\nShanahan, the 38-year-old daughter of a Chinese immigrant mother and troubled white father in Oakland, California, and was previously married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, is a major Kennedy backer. She gave $4 million to a pro-Kennedy super PAC, American Values 2024, to air the retro-style Super Bowl ad that conjured the 1960 campaign of Kennedy’s uncle, former President John F. Kennedy.\r\n“There is only one anti-war candidate today, and you won’t find him in the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. He is an independent, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.!” she declared at the close of two-and-a-half-hour campaign rally in Oakland announcing her selection.\r\n“Yes, and it is his commitment to peace and to the welfare of hardworking people in America that draws me as a person of compassion to his candidacy.”\r\nShanahan’s newness to public life was evident in her bearing at the podium. She sometimes bracketed her sentences with nervous giggles.\r\nBut she offered a moving personal story that stood in marked contrast to Kennedy’s aristocratic origins. Shanahan’s father’s substance abuse and mental health issues created economic hardship for the family, forcing them to rely on government assistance, she said. That experience “has become part of my determination to do something for our country,” she said.\r\nThe birth of Shanahan’s daughter, who was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, is part of what has driven her closer to Kennedy, who believes that chemicals in vaccines and pollutants are fueling a chronic disease epidemic.\r\nShanahan laid out her belief that a combination of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, electromagnetic “pollution” from devices like cell phones and the over-prescription of medication and other treatments have fueled maladies ranging from infertility to higher rates of autism. As vice president, she said she would spearhead a massive effort to study the causes of chronic illnesses with help from cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools.\r\n“We’ll find the answers to our most pressing health concerns within weeks, not decades,” she said, citing her confidence in the potential of unexplored government databases and corporate secrets. “We can end this chronic disease once and for all.”\r\nKennedy, an environmental attorney, anti-vaccine advocate and conspiracy theorist, considered a variety of unconventional candidates to serve as his running mate. Among the names in the mix: the rapper “Killer Mike” Render, NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and TV host Mike Rowe, Kennedy told the San Francisco-based radio station KCBS on Monday morning.\r\nKennedy told “The State of California” host Doug Sovern that Shanahan stood out because of her youth, athleticism and commitment to “unraveling the war machine and the corporate capture” of the federal government.\r\nShanahan founded ClearAccessIP, a company that aims to help entrepreneurs develop and manage patents, and sold it for an undisclosed amount in 2020.\r\nIn 2019, Shanahan launched the Bia-Echo Foundation to distribute $100 million that she is donating to programs that fight climate change, reform the criminal justice system and help women become pregnant later in life.\r\nShanahan identifies with Kennedy’s focus on the links between environmental pollution and public health problems, she told The New York Times in a February interview following the Super Bowl ad.\r\n“I do think we have an environmental health crisis in this country,” she said. “I do believe Americans deserve clean water. And we can’t achieve that in the current climate of politics.”\r\nThe attorney also shares some of Kennedy’s skepticism of vaccines.\r\n“I do wonder about vaccine injuries,” she told the Times. “I think there needs to be a space to have these conversations.”\r\nThrough his nonprofit Children’s Health Defense, Kennedy has spread fears about vaccine side effects that a broad array of experts say are unfounded. Children’s Health Defense has fueled doubts about the health risks of vaccinations for childhood diseases like measles, though these shots have been safely used for decades.\r\nKennedy has specifically supported the debunked theory that vaccines are linked to autism. In a speech about that supposed link in 2015, he compared the United States’ vaccination regime to “a Holocaust,” though he later apologized.\r\nShanahan’s wealth is clearly part of her appeal for Kennedy. In 2022, when divorcing Brin, one of the world’s richest people, she sought more than $1 billion.\r\nKennedy will need millions of dollars to obtain ballot access in all 50 states over the two major parties’ objections. Shanahan vowed to help with that on Tuesday.\r\n“Take a look at his vision for America ― it is a vision. Dare to, as I spend the next seven months of my life getting him on each and every ballot in this country,” she said.\r\nPrior to this election cycle, Shanahan was a major donor to Democratic presidential candidates, including President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign.\r\nShe has also given to a number of Democratic congressional candidates, such as Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents key parts of Silicon Valley. Shanahan is still supporting Khanna, giving him the maximum allowable amount this cycle.\r\nShanahan described her shift away from the Democratic Party as a product of her conclusion that the party’s leaders had moved away from its core values of “compassion,” “diplomacy,” “civil liberties,” and “free speech.”\r\nEven before Shanahan’s selection, national Democrats took Kennedy seriously as a threat to Biden’s re-election.\r\nIn a Tuesday afternoon conference call convened by the Democratic National Committee, Biden surrogates characterized Shanahan’s selection as a desperate attempt to finance his way onto the ballot.\r\n“There is absolutely no path for Kennedy to become president and he knows that,” said Mallory McMorrow, majority whip in the Michigan state Senate. “That is why he picked a VP who can can buy his way onto the ballot in a number of states ― while that’s disgusting, and it is an abuse of our democracy.”\r\nMcMorrow and her colleagues on the call characterized Kennedy as a “spoiler” who would boost former President Donald Trump.\r\n“His goal is to take votes away from President Biden and help elect Donald Trump,” said Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis (D).\r\nBut Republicans are apparently also worried about Kennedy’s appeal among potential Trump voters.\r\nThe pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., issued a press release blasting Kennedy and Shanahan on Tuesday.\r\n“Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a far-left radical that supports reparations, backs the Green New Deal, and wants to ban fracking,” Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesman for Make America Great Again, Inc., said in a statement. “It’s no surprise he would pick a Biden donor leftist as his running mate.”",

        "article": "Israel Blocks UNRWA’s Food Convoys From Entering Starving North Gaza\r\n\r\nThe agency's chief accused Israel of intentionally obstructing aid as Palestinians face a starvation crisis created by the military offensive.\r\n\r\nIsrael is blocking food convoys that belong to the United Nations’ Palestinian aid agency from entering Gaza’s northern region, where Palestinians are facing an increasingly dire starvation crisis created by the ongoing Israeli military offensive in the territory.\r\nAs of Sunday, Israel is denying the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) from “providing lifesaving assistance to northern Gaza,” according to Philippe Lazzarini, the agency’s chief.\r\n“Despite the tragedy unfolding under our watch, the Israeli Authorities informed the UN that they will no longer approve any [UNRWA] food convoys to the north,” Lazzarini posted on X, the former Twitter. “This is outrageous & makes it intentional to obstruct lifesaving assistance during a man made famine. These restrictions must be lifted.”\r\nUNRWA is considered the primary agency that supplies and distributes desperately needed aid and services to Palestinian refugees, including those in Gaza. While other groups are trying to bring aid into the besieged territory ― and facing hurdles from Israeli fire and a breakdown of order ― UNRWA has the resources and infrastructure to be able to provide food, water, shelter and medicine to a large population.\r\n“UNRWA is the largest organization with the highest reach to displaced communities in Gaza,” Lazzarini wrote. “By preventing UNRWA to fulfill its mandate in Gaza, the clock will tick faster towards famine & many more will die of hunger, dehydration + lack of shelter. This cannot happen, it would only stain our collective humanity.”\r\nThe block comes just days after lawmakers in the U.S. passed a spending package that included a ban on funding UNRWA through March 2025, extending President Joe Biden’s current funding suspension triggered by Israel’s accusations that a dozen of UNRWA’s some 13,000 employees participated in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\r\nSince the accusation, most of UNRWA’s major contributors have resumed their funding, citing Gaza’s starvation crisis and the lack of concrete evidence from Israel to back up its claim. UNRWA terminated the 12 accused employees and is undergoing internal and external investigations into the allegation, though Lazzarini has accused Israel of deliberately trying to undermine UNRWA so the agency is forced to dissolve.\r\nLazzarini said he appreciates the lawmakers in Congress who advocated for UNRWA, as well as Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s support with the European Union last week, but that the funding ban from the U.S. ― UNRWA’s biggest contributor ― will “have implications” for Palestinian refugees.\r\n“In Gaza, the humanitarian community is racing against the clock to avert famine. As the backbone of the humanitarian response, any gap in funding to UNRWA will compromise access to food, shelter, primary health care & education at a time of deep trauma,” Lazzarini wrote Sunday on X. “Palestine Refugees are counting on the international community to step up support to meet their basic needs.”\r\nLast week, Lazzarini said that Israeli authorities barred him from entering Gaza, where he was supposed to help coordinate and improve the humanitarian response to the crisis. That denial allegedly occurred on the same day that the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative sounded the alarm on famine-like conditions in north Gaza, as well as the territory’s entire population of 2 million people facing crisis levels of food insecurity or worse.\r\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres visited the Rafah crossing on Saturday to “spotlight the hardship and pain of Palestinians in Gaza,” calling for an immediate cease-fire as he stood near thousands of aid trucks waiting in line to enter the territory from Egypt. More than 1 million Palestinians in Gaza are currently sheltering in Rafah, the territory’s southernmost city, where Israel is threatening to invade despite warnings from the U.S. and the rest of the international community against doing so.\r\nOn Monday, more than five months after the start of the war, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. The council approved the resolution 14-0 ― with the U.S. abstaining ― marking the first time it has officially demanded a halt to the violence. The pause in fighting would last until the end of Ramadan, on April 9, though the draft said that the temporary cease-fire should lead “to a permanent sustainable cease-fire.”\r\n“Fasting with you on Ramadan, I am deeply troubled to know so many people in Gaza will not be able to have a proper Iftar. Here from the crossing, we see the heartbreak and heartlessness of it all,” Guterres said at the Rafah crossing on Saturday. “A long line of blocked relief trucks on one side of the gates. The long shadow of starvation on the other. That is more than tragic. It is a moral outrage.”\r\n“It’s time to truly flood Gaza with life-saving aid. The choice is clear: either surge or starvation,” he continued. “Let’s choose the side of help ― the side of hope ― and the right side of history. I will not give up. And all of us must not give up in doing all we can for our common humanity to prevail in Gaza and around the world.”",

They were laughing,” said Eric, who is executive vice president at the Trump Organization.\r\nOnline, people seemed to wonder if people were laughing with the Trumps, or at them.\r\nJudge Engoron calculated the nine-figure penalty by adding the amount of money the Trump Organization gained through fraudulent financial statements with years of interest, landing at a total of $464 million.\r\nThough the Trump Organization filed an immediate appeal to Judge Engoron’s Feb. 16 conviction, the company is required to pay the penalties in full by Monday, lest the company’s assets be seized by the state of New York.\r\nThe Trumps have yet to sway a lender to back their bid for a retrial.\r\nLast week in legal filings, representatives for the organization said obtaining the $464 million bond by the deadline is “a practical impossibility.”\r\nThe brief claimed the Trump Organization had contacted 30 bond companies and few would even “consider a bond of anything approaching” that level of liability.\r\nAfter his appearance on Fox on Sunday, Eric Trump continued to make his case for the company on X, formerly Twitter.\r\nThere, he told followers the mere “notion of seizing properties owned by the Former President of the United States” would shatter trust “in the entire legal system in the United States.”\r\nOf course, plenty of people had their own responses.",

        "article": "World to reckon with future of fossil fuels at COP28 climate summit\n\nDelegates from nearly 200 countries will convene this week for the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, where conference host and OPEC member, the UAE, hopes to sell the vision of a low-carbon future that includes, not shuns, fossil fuels.\nThat narrative, also backed by other big oil producer nations, will reveal international divisions at the summit over how to combat global warming.\nCountries are split over whether to prioritise phasing out coal and oil and gas, or scaling up technologies such as carbon capture to try to diminish their climate impact.\nThe annual United Nations summit from 30 November to 12 December takes place as the world is poised to shatter another record for the hottest year in 2023, and as reports confirm, countries’ climate pledges are not enough to avert the worst impacts of global warming.\nAmong the decisions nations must make in the gleaming, high-tech city of Dubai will be whether to agree, for the first time, to gradually “phase out” global consumption of fossil fuels and replace them with sources including solar and wind.\nThe International Energy Agency, the West’s energy watchdog, issued a report ahead of the conference defining its position.\nIt called the idea of widespread carbon capture, to contain emissions from burning fossil fuels, an illusion and said the fossil fuel industry must decide between deepening the climate crisis or shifting to clean energy.\nIn response, OPEC accused the IEA of vilifying oil producers.\nGreenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the biggest cause of climate change.\n\nOil man at the helm\nThe arguments for and against continued use of fossil fuel have focused on COP’s incoming President, Sultan Al-Jaber.\nHis position as CEO of the UAE’s national oil company, ADNOC, has raised concerns among campaigners, some US Congress members and EU lawmakers over whether he can be an impartial broker of a climate deal.\nJaber has vehemently denied a report from the BBC and the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) that he planned to discuss potential gas and other commercial deals with over a dozen governments ahead of the summit.\n“These allegations are false, not true, incorrect, are not accurate. And it’s an attempt to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency,” Jaber told a news conference on Wednesday.\nJaber has said the phase-down of fossil fuels is “inevitable”, but also that the industry needs to be included in the debate of finding climate solutions and presented himself as ideally placed to mediate.\nClimate campaigners are not reassured.\n“We have a world which has more fossil fuels than ever,” said Ani Dasgupta, President of the World Resources Institute, a climate NGO. “What we should be looking for is a commitment to actually reduce fossil fuels.”\nJaber says he has been rallying support from companies for COP28 pledges aimed at reducing emissions from oil and gas operations.\nMany representatives of the industry will be present in Dubai as this year’s gathering of 70,000 registered attendees takes on the character of trade show.\nOrganisers say the record attendance will include the biggest business participation for any UN climate summit yet.\nIndian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and Britain’s King Charles are also set to attend, although US President Joe Biden will not.\n\nTaking stock\nAway from the high-profile visitors, a major task for the country delegations at COP28 will be to assess how far off track the world is from a goal set in Paris in 2015 to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while aiming for a cap of 1.5C.\nThis process, known as the global stocktake, should yield a high-level plan telling countries what they need to do.\nGovernments will then have to turn that global plan into national policies and targets to submit to the UN in 2025.\nLeading up to the conference, the European Union, US and UAE have rallied support for a deal to triple global renewable energy installed by 2030. Over 100 countries have backed this deal, officials told Reuters, but countries including China and India have not.\nUS officials and others are hopeful a climate deal agreed earlier this month between the world’s biggest emitters, China and the US, may also set a positive tone for the talks.\nThe two countries agreed to boost renewable energy and “accelerate the substitution for coal, oil and gas generation”.\n\nClimate finance\nAnother task for the conference is to launch the world’s first climate damage fund to help countries that have already suffered irreparable damage from climate change impacts, such as drought, floods and rising sea levels.\nRepresentatives from developed and developing countries have struck a tentative agreement on its design, but all countries at COP28 need to approve it for it to lead to a final deal.\nGayane Gabrielyan, Armenia’s negotiator on the fund, told Reuters it is crucial the “loss and damage” fund agreement is approved now, ahead of elections next year in countries, such as the US, that could shatter the political consensus.\nAnother test is whether wealthy nations announce hundreds of millions of dollars needed to launch the fund at COP28. The European Union and the US have already said they will contribute, and are pressuring countries like China and the UAE to follow.\n“Speaking from previous experience, unfortunately most of the global agreements, most of the global climate related pledges went uncompleted,” said Najib Ahmed, National Consultant at Somalia’s Climate Ministry.\n“But again, we cannot lose hope.”",

He said, “The unjust, aggressive war that we are facing is a war against the Palestinian existence and the Palestinian national identity, the identity of the land and the identity of the people.”\r\nHe added: “We are confronting together a barbaric war of aggression and an open war of genocide against our people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including Jerusalem, our eternal capital.”\r\nOn the same day, the Israeli occupation forces raided the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza, the largest hospital in the besieged Strip, which shelters thousands of people displaced by the Israeli aggression on the cities of the Strip. This happened despite international appeals not to attack the hospital.\r\nThe Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the Israeli occupation forces raid on Al-Shifa Hospital as a violation of international humanitarian law, especially the Geneva Convention. It held Israel responsible for the safety of civilians and medical staff working in the hospital.\r\nThe ministry emphasized that “the dangerous situation in Gaza requires the UN Security Council to bear its legal responsibility and the international community to bear its moral responsibilities and work to pressure Israel, the occupying power, to stop its ongoing aggression, war, and targeting of civilians, especially women, and children, which cannot be justified by any reason or excuse.”\r\nMeanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that his country would continue to “isolate Israel internationally and provide all forms of support to Palestine.” He said that Israel would be known as a “cursed terrorist state” everywhere in the world. He added, “We will continue to isolate Israel in the international arena while providing all forms of humanitarian support to Palestine in a dual plan.”\r\nHe also said that Turkey would continue “to take steps to ensure that Israeli political and military leaders are tried before international courts after they brutally killed the oppressed people of Gaza.” He claimed that “Israel is implementing a strategy of destruction of Gaza City and its residents. I say it frankly and with a calm heart: Israel is a terrorist state.”\r\nIn addition, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called on Israel to end the “random killing” in Gaza. He reiterated his support for Israel’s “response to the terrorist attack” carried out by Hamas on October 7, and promised that his new government “would work in Europe and Spain to recognize the Palestinian state.”\r\nThe Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Catherine Russell, denounced the “horrific” scenes she witnessed during a visit to the Gaza Strip as part of the Israeli aggression on Gaza. She called for “this horror to stop.”\r\nRussell, who visited the southern Gaza Strip, said: “What I saw and heard was heart-breaking. They have endured bombing, loss, and repeated displacement. Inside the Gaza Strip, there is no safe place for Gaza’s million children to take refuge.” She added, “Only the parties to the conflict can truly stop this horror.”",

        "article": "The West’s mask is off\r\n\r\nThe problem with a state’s claim to ‘exceptionalism’ is that this is often interpreted as bringing with it a special status with unique privileges and infallibility. We are used to hearing about the US claiming an almost divine status. It seeks to impose its brand of democracy in the Muslim world, causes carnage and consistently loses wars it begins. This time it has encouraged and supported Israel in a war without any red lines. The hope of and access to mechanisms of justice and the rule of law have been eviscerated. The Muslim world has however been unified. At the heart of its own faith is the imperative to act justly.\r\nThe two state solution is an aberration – a ruse. If a permanent ceasefire does not transpire Israel and the US will find themselves in the midst of a regional conflict which they will lose devastatingly.\r\nThe current conflict is not limited to Gaza and the West Bank. It is gradually embracing ever widening interests. Israel has no appetite for a just resolution. Justice and equity are concepts it is allergic to. The subhuman barbarity of the holocaust spurned the sentiment ‘never again.’ That should be ‘never again for all humanity.’ Netanyahu’s government and all those complicit in his current ethnic cleansing project have excluded a class of homo sapiens from humanity. On 28 October he stated: ‘You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible’. This was a reference to a version of the Torah (Samuel 15:3): ‘Spare no one, but kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings, oxen and sheep, camels and asses.’ It is simply fallacious to attribute this mindset to Jews as a whole. Jews of varying complexion from across a spectrum of nuances in faith and identity are also staunch human rights defenders seeking peace and justice. Islam guarantees to them their freedom of faith. That is unimpeachable. This conflict is down to the conduct of the state of Israel as a long-standing US asset.\r\nIn the meantime, the UN has remained impotent. Diplomacy has completely failed. Spinless Western states are acting in concert. Justice has no seat at the table. The imposition of apartheid remains unabated. Genocide is playing out before our eyes. Israel’s ‘self defence’ is characterised by rampant butchery while it peddles pathological lies to a largely subservient Western media machine. International legal instruments have been reduced to ashes. The deprivation of food, water, medicines, and electricity, in addition to relentless bombing of refugee camps, hospitals, schools, humanitarian missions and fleeing crowds is part of Israel’s war strategy. We are witnessing the second Nakba.\r\nA whole set of existential problems prevail. These include: The express acceptance that Palestinian life is worthless. A declaration that the Middle East will change. A further step closer to the achievement of a Greater Israel. And Israel’s continued ‘right’ to transcend rule of law and humanity. There is no such thing as an effective liberal political West when it comes to the Palestinian issue. Previously, Keir Starmer (the next likely British Prime Minster) and I worked together on legal cases. In 2000 he trained judges on human rights law and authored a book about the subject. He recently stated Israel had the right to withhold electricity and water from civilians in Gaza. At the time of writing, he continues to oppose a ceasefire. US Senator Lindsay Graham has called for wholesale destruction of Gaza as part of a religious war. Muslim culture has been described as being in the grip of a death cult. There has been a call for a Nakba that overshadows 1948.\r\nThese statements are set against a new world order in which the US is no longer in control. The global south, China, Russia, and the Middle East do not support the colonial project. I venture to suggest the agenda is not purely political or strategic in nature but also ideological. Israel wants maps redrawn and to reach, in due course, amongst other territories, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our two Holy Cities are vulnerable. After all Jerusalem has been carved up. Applying the same rationale for a Greater Israel means Yathrib is also included.\r\nMuslim states are not (if they so wish) beholden to these dynamics. They have a collective duty to the Nation of Muslims and all those who live with them.\r\nThere is no legal prohibition to provide immediate humanitarian relief. Muslim countries cannot postpone taking on the task of opening a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the needs of Palestinians in Gaza. A call to do so must not be subordinate to Israel’s, the West’s, or the UN’s dictates. A child dying every few minutes during the Israeli onslaught does not give any room for a wait and see approach.\r\nA time for Muslim states to renew their faith and dignity. In this second part of my two part article I examine Israel’s aggression juxtaposed with the Nation of Muslims.\r\nNothing should discourage countries surrounding Gaza and the West Bank allowing a humanitarian and peacekeeping mission - comprising representatives from armies of each Muslim nation and any other country wishing to participate - from being deployed to support a just cause. There needs to be an end to the grotesque punishment.\r\nFor a unified body of Muslim states to act they must collectively change their psychological and philosophical mindset from a secular to Islamic pattern. Muslim states need to reinvigorate their faith in the face of all other doors being shut. Such revival is dependent on two critical triggers. Firstly, belief in Allah (the ultimate and exclusive source of power) and secondly, love for the Holy Prophet (SWS). The former is engaged by worship without limit, and the latter requires love without limit.\r\nFaith has been prevalent amongst Muslims in every era. It has never been extinguished. Islam supported our history favourably when faith was paramount, and it dictated our conduct and direction of accountability. Faith and history walked together.\r\nThe recent Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit hosted by Saudi Arabia was significant. Israel’s conduct has acted as a catalyst precipitating the unification of the Muslim Street and Muslim states. The terms of normalisation are now going to be vastly different.\r\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi attended the meeting in Riyadh - the first visit by an Iranian president in 11 years. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani while recognising Muslims ‘are peace advocates’ (contrary to the West’s routine maligning portrayal) stated that double standards were no longer acceptable. He went on to observe:\r\n‘What is happening is very dangerous, it includes trampling not only on international law, but also all values, norms, and religious and worldly laws, besides the proclaimed Israeli remarks of its illegal intentions such as displacement, and so forth…We are saying enough is enough.’\r\nMuslim states have an opportunity to renew their confidence, dignity, and assertiveness. A preamble should recall our history not as a war cry but to highlight the extent of Allah’s far reaching favours on Muslim states.\r\nIn the seventh century our venerable military commander, Khalid ibn al-Walid, fought and defeated the Byzantines in the Battles of Hazir, Ajnadayn and Yarmouk. Having conquered Mesopotamia Yarmouk represented one of our greatest successes.\r\nThe eighth century, Umayyad caliph, Umar bin Abdul-Aziz, reformed the Muslim empire. During his reign, Muslim forces in Al-Andalus conquered and fortified the Mediterranean coastal city of Narbonne in modern-day France.\r\nUnder Muslim rule for more than 750 years Spain shone as Europe’s cultural centre. Tariq bin Ziyad led the conquest of Spain. He was arguably the most important military leader in Iberian history. In poetic contrast to UK’s ‘stop the boats’ policy, Tariq burnt his boats to inspire a small army after entering Spain by sea in 711 A.D. Having glorified Allah, he delivered his now famous address.\r\nAyyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi, an Umayyad governor who ruled Al-Andalus in the eighth century, was the first Muslim commander to cross the Pyrenees in 717. North African Governor, Musa bin Nusair, and Tariq bin Ziyad ruled most of the Iberian Peninsula and occupied Lyons.\r\nAbd Al Rahman ibn Abd Allah Al-Ghafiqi invaded France in 732 and defeated the Duke of Aquitaine. Al-Ghafiqi advanced as far as Tours, in central France. Numerous Muslim incursions into Gaul followed.\r\nAbd Al Ramān I, also called al-Dākhil, flourished between 750–788 in Spain and defeated armies sent by Charlemagne (who had united most of Europe).\r\nQutayba ibn Muslim, another Arab commander, led the conquest of Transoxiana. He also conquered Xinjiang. In 751, the Muslims successfully fought the Tang Chinese army and Karluk mercenaries in the Battle of Talas. China ceased recapture of Transoxiana.\r\nIn 1187 the Battle of Hattin, in northern Palestine, was one of two decisive battles in the Middle East. Salah al-Din destroyed Christian crusader armies. The other battle was at Al Mansurah.\r\nRukn al-Din Baybars al-Bunduqdari, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria, defeated the Seventh Crusade of King Louis IX of France at the Battle of Al Mansurah (in 1250) which led to the end of Crusader presence. He also led the Egyptian army in a decisive defeat of the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. This was a turning point in history. The Mongols of the Golden Horde embraced Islam and forged strong ties. His military campaign also extended into Libya and Nubia.\r\nThe Ottomans ruled for over six centuries from 1299 and added Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia, Albania, Romania, and Hungary to their empire.\r\nUnder the sixth Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (also known as Alamgir I who reigned until 1707) the Mughal Empire spanned nearly the entirety of the Indian subcontinent.\r\nOur history is richer than any treasure. US continuing to underwrite the war does not therefore mean Palestine will cease. The US is weak financially and has a deteriorating army. It is under attack in Syria and Iraq. Yemen has joined the fray. Israel’s own army is small and inexperienced. On the flip side, President Erdogan has described Hamas as a liberation group fighting to protect Palestinian lands. Turkey has a huge army of ferocious fighters that could be deployed if necessary. Pakistan will inevitably provide nuclear warheads if the Muslim world is threatened. A handful of both nations’ air force pilots could police Palestinian skies and push back the Israelis with little effort.\r\nIf Eygpt’s hand was forced, it would gain Turkey’s support. Troop numbers would dwarf the Americans and Israelis. Iran has an enormous arsenal of missiles and rockets aimed at Israel. China and Russia have aligned interests with Iran. North African states would doubtless join any counter offensive.\r\nThe US is not ‘indispensable’ as Madeline Albright once claimed. It has permitted Israel to put its very existence at risk either in the current conflict, or certainly, next time round. As Qatar’s Emir wisely proclaimed, enough is enough. His words were profound and should be heeded.",

In fact, he thinks it's a bad move that makes them look bad. He also says that the Palestinian resistance is still fighting, even though they don't have fancy weapons like the Israeli army.\r\n\r\nWhy Storm a Hospital?\r\nAl-Duwairi wonders why the Israeli army felt the need to storm a hospital. There were no armed men inside, just medical teams, wounded people, and some displaced individuals. Did they really need an army to go into the hospital's intensive care or premature infants' departments? It doesn't make much sense, does it?\r\n\r\nThe Palestinian Resistance\r\nAccording to the military expert, the Palestinian resistance in Gaza still has the ability to launch rockets and missiles into Israel. They might not have as many weapons as the Israeli army, but they're still fighting back. They're sending a message that they're still here and ready for battle.\r\n\r\nThe Battle Continues\r\nThe fighting between the resistance and the Israeli army is still going on. There's a lot of intense fighting happening near Al-Jalaa Street and in the Beach camp. Even though the Israeli army entered some areas of Gaza a few days ago, there are still groups of resistance fighters holding their ground.\r\n\r\nThe Size of the Battle\r\nThis battle in Gaza is between small groups of resistance fighters and a huge army of 650,000 soldiers. The Israeli army also has support from countries like America, Britain, Germany, and France. It's a tough fight for the resistance, but they're not giving up.\r\n\r\nWhat the Resistance is Doing\r\nThe resistance is being smart about their attacks. They're using their limited missile systems strategically. They're launching missiles in small groups and targeting specific places. This way, they show that they still have power and are ready to fight.\r\nThe Palestinian resistance is still fighting back, even though they don't have as many weapons.

In an interview with Al Jazeera Net, Shlaim explains why he thinks this war is \"meaningless\" and discusses the biased support that the West provides to Israel.\r\n\r\nThe Historical Background\r\nShlaim argues that the conflict did not start on October 7th. To understand why Hamas carried out the attack, we need to look back to 1967 when Israel occupied Palestinian territories. The Israelis claim that they offered the Palestinians the chance to turn Gaza into a prosperous place like Singapore, but instead, they turned it into an open prison.\r\n\r\nThe Disproportionate Response\r\nWhile media attention focused on the Hamas attack, Shlaim condemns both the attack and the Israeli reaction. He believes that the Israeli response was cruel, brutal, and completely disproportionate. Revenge is not a solution, and what Israel is doing can be considered state-sponsored terrorism.\r\n\r\nNetanyahu and the West's Handling of the War\r\nShlaim predicts that Netanyahu will not survive politically, and he criticizes the Western response to the crisis for its hypocrisy and double standards. He points out that when Hamas won the elections in 2006, Israel, the European Union, and the United States refused to recognize the Hamas government and imposed economic sanctions. The Western powers have been biased towards Israel and have given it the green light to carry out horrific acts instead of calling for a ceasefire.\r\n\r\nPotential Consequences\r\nShlaim notes that over the past 20 years, Jewish hostility towards Arabs in Israel has increased significantly. The current right-wing government, influenced by religious Zionism, is the most extreme, chauvinistic, and racist government in Israel's history. Because of the war in Gaza, public sentiment may shift further to the right and become more hostile towards Arabs.\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism vs. Anti-Zionism\r\nShlaim clarifies the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. Anti-Semitism is hatred towards Jews solely because of their Jewish identity and has nothing to do with Israel. Anti-Zionism, on the other hand, is criticism and opposition to the Zionist ideology, particularly regarding Israel's policies towards Palestinians, such as occupation, apartheid, and the use of force.\r\n",

Despite Israeli measures, Sayyed Nasrallah declared that there has been a quantitative increase in resistance operations. In addition, new types of weapons have been introduced, such as the use of attack drones, during the resistance operations. \r\nThe Resistance leader also unveiled that Hezbollah was using the renowned Burkan missiles against the Israeli occupation. \"The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon began using 'Burkan' missiles, which weigh up to half a ton, in its operations.\"\r\n\"The operations of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon going deeper into the occupied territories have increased,\" he added. Meanwhile, Israeli media acknowledged that more than 350 Israeli wounded, including critical injuries, have been taken to hospitals.\r\n\"The Israeli occupation admitted that the level of attacks by the Resistance has risen significantly, so its level of anxiety is simultaneously on the rise,\" Sayyed Nasrallah highlighted. \"The rise in the level of anxiety of the Israelis caused the level of threats to Lebanon to mount as well.\"",

(specifically, Alexandria, Va.).”\n“Climate migration is already taking place within American communities, new data finds, as people flee flood-prone areas, and create ‘climate abandonment’ zones,” writes an unquestioning Axios. [emphasis, links added]\n“The study constitutes the latest warning sign of the effects of climate change,” Axios continues without skepticism. “Population shifts, and a larger reckoning for real estate, are only expected to worsen as global average surface temperatures rise.”\nBut then the premise of the study undercuts itself in a big way with the admission that “Americans are leaving the Rust Belt in droves and heading to areas of greater climate risk in the South and Southwest[.]”\nWhat’s more, “cities with high flood risks, like Miami and Houston, are still pulling in more people than they are losing,” the study admits. “But these areas are growing more slowly than they would be if flooding weren’t such a threat, the study shows.”\nA good faith reading of the study tells me that the conclusions come from projections and math equations. Nowhere does it say that the actual people who moved were surveyed or questioned about why they moved.\nThe study also uses a math problem to explain away “local political, social, and economic conditions” — but you have to talk to people to understand their motive for moving.\nAdditionally, as stated above, the study admits that most of the country’s migration is to areas that are “of greater climate risk.”\nThe study fails to mention that real estate on the coasts, the areas that would be most at risk if climate change were real is increasing in value, not decreasing.\nIf you recall, Mr. Climate Change himself, Barack Obama, spent millions on a mansion just a few feet from the same ocean that’s supposed to wipe out the coast.\nThe Climate Change Channel, CNN, moved its headquarters from the safe, inland city of Atlanta to the edge of the water in Manhattan — the same Manhattan the “experts” told us would be flooded by now.\nSo let me tell you what I think is happening here. Granted, this is only one man’s opinion. We’re still allowed to have opinions, correct?\nOkay, so one of the most devastating facts in the political world today is Americans voting with their feet.\nPeople are fleeing Democrat-run cities for MAGA Country.\nAnd it’s not because of impending danger from some unicorn called climate change; it’s because Democrat Party policies are disastrous when implemented. Ahh, but…\n…If that exodus can be blamed on climate change, Democrats are not only no longer on defense when it comes to the devastating truth about population loss, but they can spin it around into a talking point they love: People are leaving our cities because of climate change and here’s why we need socialism.\n",

Never has Britain seen such a toxic, divisive interior minister who has, through a series of statements and policy moves, catered to the far right of the conservative base while demonising minorities and even the homeless.\r\nThe last straw appeared to be an article Braverman wrote for ‘The Times’ newspaper, where she accused the police of bias in handling pro Palestinian protesters, saying the cops were tougher on right wing demonstrators.\r\nIt has been widely reported in the British media that Braverman defied an order from Number 10 to tone down the article — a piece that was seen as having crossed a red line of political interference in the police’s functioning.\r\nUltimately, Rishi Sunak had to sack her to show he was still the boss. Braverman was also roundly criticised for stoking tensions in London through her comments ahead of a planned protest on Armistice Day calling for a Gaza ceasefire. Braverman had described the pro Palestinian protests as a ‘hate march’.\r\nIronically, those protests passed off peacefully and the violence came from counter protesters from the right wing who had come out to confront the pro palestianian marchers. Nine police officers were injured. The Met police later condemned the “extreme violence from right wing protesters”.\r\n\r\nDog whistle politics\r\nSome commentators believe Rishi Sunak may have made a mistake by sacking Braverman and that this will stir up a bitter battle within the Tory party for the leadership ahead of the next general election which is due sometime next year.\r\nA senior Tory MP, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Braverman’s sacking will hit the Conservatives’ chances of winning and that, “Suella understands what the country thinks about migration”. But is politics only about winning elections and resorting to dog whistle statements to do so?\r\nSuella Braverman has exhibited anything but exemplary leadership skills. She has used hate to get ahead and that is just not OK. Just a glance at some of her statements over the past year tell you exactly what she stands for.\r\n“We cannot allow our streets to be taken over by rows of tents occupied by people, many of them from abroad, living on the streets as a lifestyle choice,” Braverman recently said triggering off revulsion even within her own party.\r\nAddressing the Conservative Party at its annual conference earlier this year, she described migration as “a “hurricane that would bring millions more immigrants to these shores, uncontrolled and unmanageable.” UK governments had been “far too squeamish” she said about being “smeared as racist to properly bring order to the chaos.”\r\n\r\nGood riddance\r\nIn an earlier speech in which she addressed an American think tank, she warned that countries faced an “existential” threat unless they were able to control their borders. Ironically, this extreme hard line comes from a woman who is of Indian origin. Her parents both trace their roots to India and emigrated to the UK in the 1960s.\r\nHer comments on “gender ideology” which she described as a“woke” and “highly controversial” thesis, evoked even sharper responses. There was a very public and angry reaction from Tory London Assembly member Andrew Boff who said “I’m a loyal Tory.....This is not what our Conservative party is about.”\r\nIt took many people by surprise when Rishi Sunak first appointed Braverman to the Home Secretary’s position especially since she had lost the same job under Prime Minister Liz Truss only weeks earlier over using her private email for sharing confidential cabinet papers with another Tory MP.\r\nPerhaps at the time Sunak was trying to please everyone in his badly divided party at the time. Things have obviously shifted with the return of former Prime Minister David Cameron in his cabinet. It is entirely possible that Braverman will seek the Tory leadership now and paint herself as a martyr.\r\nAlready, a number of Tory MPs leaning more to the right are coming out in her support. This will put the ideology of the Tories to test at a time when the party has been more diverse than ever before. Till then, it’s good riddance to Suella/Cruella Braverman.",

Never has Britain seen such a toxic, divisive interior minister who has, through a series of statements and policy moves, catered to the far right of the conservative base while demonising minorities and even the homeless.\r\nThe last straw appeared to be an article Braverman wrote for ‘The Times’ newspaper, where she accused the police of bias in handling pro Palestinian protesters, saying the cops were tougher on right wing demonstrators.\r\nIt has been widely reported in the British media that Braverman defied an order from Number 10 to tone down the article — a piece that was seen as having crossed a red line of political interference in the police’s functioning.\r\nUltimately, Rishi Sunak had to sack her to show he was still the boss. Braverman was also roundly criticised for stoking tensions in London through her comments ahead of a planned protest on Armistice Day calling for a Gaza ceasefire. Braverman had described the pro Palestinian protests as a ‘hate march’.",

When measured by value, this exponential surge becomes even more evident: from 32 million euros in 2022 to a whopping 303 million today.\r\nGerman news agency dpa has reported that \"only\" 6 % of that export volume is made up of actual weaponry (a 4% increase compared to last year), while the rest is made up of warfare-aiding equipment such as bulletproof vehicles and military trucks. In line with its utter disregard for transparency, the German government does not disclose details of the deals in order to protect the manufacturers who are making a veritable killing off of their killing machinery (Germany’s military exports totaled 8.76 billion euros in the first three quarters of this year).\r\nThe not-so-subtle message underlying the country’s current military-industrial hustle and bustle is clear, as if to say: “We see you, Israel, as you engage in genocide against a people we also couldn’t care less about. And since we Germans know a thing or two about racist mass murder, yet cannot openly assist you because we have, you know, “learned from our history”, we will do the next best thing: supply you with the equipment needed for your racist orgies of indiscriminate bloodshed.”\r\nGermany’s rewarding of genocidaires by fast-tracking defence export approvals to \"Israel\" is by no means surprising: the former’s staunch moral support for \"Israel\" following Hamas’s October 7 attack in the form of effusive solidarity rhetoric has turned out to be a prelude to more sinister things to come. And what is more sinister apart from committing genocide than arming its executors?\r\nFurthermore, Germany’s Ministry of Economic Affairs, which in 2021 added climate action to its portfolio and name, is headed by the virulently pro-\"Israel\" Robert Habeck, an increasingly anti-climate justice Green party politician: he has repeatedly attacked the environmental protest group Letzte Generation for its impressive direct actions, and has in all seriousness said that the so-called “Klimafrage” (the question of climate change), should not be put above everything else.\r\nWith regards to the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza and the violent repression of pro-Palestinian solidarity in Germany, the self-important economy minister recently overstepped the boundaries of his jurisdictional authority by airing a ten-minute video message on antisemitism in which he, like most of his country’s debauched political ruling class has done already, defamed Palestinian-led anti-war protests as examples of Jew-hatred.\r\nIt seems as if Habeck, a senior card-carrying member of a party that once stood for pacifism and universal human rights, is not much more than an externally controlled dummy of the war-mongering master ventriloquist that is the Israel lobby: he recently gave in to the pressure of an open letter signed by over 300 Israeli businesspeople demanding he cancel his participation at this month’s Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal.\r\nWhy? Because its Irish co-founder, Paddy Cosgrave, had dared to publicly condemn \"Israel’s\" war on Gaza by posting the following to social media platform X: “I’m shocked at the rhetoric and actions of so many Western leaders & governments, with the exception in particular, of Ireland’s government, who for once are doing the right thing. War crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies, and should be called out for what they are.”\r\nThe post has since been deleted and Cosgrave forced to step down from his position as CEO amidst the reactionary backlash he has faced for daring to do the right thing. As for Habeck: isn’t it remarkable how German politicians who routinely slander the BDS movement as antisemitic have no beef with boycotts when they are implemented in the service of Israeli settler colonialism, apartheid and genocide?\r\nThe German coalition government’s tenfold increase in arms exports to \"Israel\" is not only an indictment of the ethical bankruptcy of the co-governing Green Party, but also of the blatant double standards at play in the murky realm of Germany’s weapons exports approval regime: the former government under Angela Merkel did not hesitate to implement a near total arms export ban on Saudi Arabia in November 2018 for its leading role in the war in Yemen, yet Germany’s current leaders have failed to act similarly with regards to \"Israel\" as it flattens Gaza by air, land and sea.\r\nAfter the profuse moral support for \"Israel’s\" psychopathic war against Palestinians on their own land, now comes Germany’s military support in the form of expedited arms sales. In doing so, the world’s fourth largest merchant of death is aiding and abetting a genocide in Gaza where Palestinian civilian deaths in one month have surpassed the reported total in almost two years of war in Ukraine.\r\nFor shame, Germany. For shame.",

It’s literally insane!\nAs Time Magazine predicted all the way back in 1977, the real data show that the world is actually cooling, and we are rapidly headed into a new ice age. Hear anything about that these days in the woke mainstream media? No, of course not. The media are shills for the billionaire elites and the #ClimateHoax.\nSo let’s take a few minutes to go over the real facts of the “climate crisis” in 2023.\n\n“The Ice Caps are Melting”\nBullshit. Temperatures at the poles have been diving over the past four decades.\n[Infographics showing a reduction in temperature in both the Antarctic and the Arctic, sources cited]\nYou can look at either pole and the story is the same; we’re in a period of dramatic cool down.\n\n“Sea Ice is Shrinking”\nMore lies! Global sea ice is at its greatest extent since at least the late 1970's.\n[Infographics showing gobal sea ice levels, sources cited]\nEven if you’re looking just at the Antarctic, sea ice extent has been at record levels most of the year.\n\n“The Glaciers are Retreating”\nMore climate scammer BS.\n[Photos of two glaciers takes at ~20 years apart, sources cited]\nPast and present photos prove that glaciers are surging, not retreating. Increased snowfall has caused glaciers to expand around the world!\n\n“Sea Surface Temperatures Were at Record Highs”\nYou mean record lows, right climate alarmist scum?\nSea surface temperatures dove to record lows in March and have stayed there ever since.\n[Infographics showing sea suface temperatures, sources cited]\nIt doesn’t matter which ocean you look at, they’re all the same: record low temperatures all year.\nIn fact, sea surface temperatures have been falling for over 100 years.\nWhat we should be worried about is not fake heat, but how these record cold temperatures are affecting vital fisheries.\n\n“Sea Levels are Rising”\nThis one is just too crazy to believe! The climate hoaxers are asking us to deny the evidence of our very own eyes!\n[Line chart showing the mean sea level value across the years, source cited]\nThe fact is that the rapid cooling of the planet has caused sea level to drop as glaciers expand.\nWhat we should be worried about are impacts that sea level drop will have on tourism, not fake beach erosion and imaginary flooding.\n\n“It’s Getting Hotter”\nBy now it should be pretty obvious that if the poles are colder, glaciers and sea ice are expanding, sea levels are dropping, and sea temperatures are dropping… that it’s not getting hotter.\nThis is the biggest climate scam of all.\nWalk outside. I dare you. Is it hot or cold? It’s cold, right?\nThat’s because it’s called winter, and winter is cold. Duh. Climate scammers think we’re all idiots!\nBut the truth is that it’s the climate hoaxers who are idiots.\n[Infographics showing montly and yearly air temperature anomalies]\nEven the Japanese know it’s a scam! It’s been getting colder every year since at least 1890!\nThey’re even trying to tell us that 2023 was the hottest year on record, when the truth is that 2023 was the coldest year in the past 125,000 years!\nAnd what about those vaunted “global warming stripes”?? Fake, of course.\nInstead of worrying about how “global warming” is going to impact the tropics, we should worry about global cooling will hurt tropical rainforests.\n\nHow to Stop the Lies\nOne of the best ways to avoid falling for the endless lies of the climate scammers is to follow some truly impartial climate experts on X. Lord Elon has made sure that X is a bastion of truth and free speech, and these folks are worth a follow! [List of names]\nDon’t let upside down world win. Fight back with the truth.\n\nDenouement\nIf you haven’t figured it out by now, all the data in these graphs — while taken from and linked to the original source — has been inverted. Thus, “upside down world.”\nThis story was inspired (if that’s the word) by a Tweet from Zack Labe showing how some climate denier troll had basically just inverted his graph and posted it as fact.\nI realized that (having been a professional photographer for nearly 20 years), I had way better Photoshop skills than that guy.\nAlso, having spent a week dancing with the trolls, I felt inspired to do the laziest climate troll imitation that I could — not even bothering to make up data, just inverting a bunch of graphs in Photoshop and swapping out before and after photos.\nI sincerely hope that no one is mad at me for putting their data in “upside down world”. Zack, I know I picked on you a lot, but you have some of the best climate graphics out there!\n\nA Final Word\nI honestly think that if what is satirically portrayed in this story were actually happening (i.e., we were entering an ice age at this insanely rapid rate), the entire world would be frantically trying to do something about it.\nBut the fossil fuel companies have done their work so well that a large part of the populus — and most of the rich and powerful — refuse to even listen.\nThey are the ones living in upside down world.",

He is launching a counterattack on his online platform.\r\nNew York – Donald Trump doesn’t let anyone dictate anything to him. He proves that again and again. Current example: He is now testing what the restricted speech ban in the upcoming hush money trial in New York is all about. Just a day after Judge Juan Merchan banned him from publicly commenting on those involved in the trial, Trump launched the next verbal attack on his online platform Truth Social.\r\nThis time his anger was directed at the judge himself. In Trump's eyes, he is seriously ill. And why? Because he suffers from an “acute case of Trump Derangement Syndrome”. Merchan had issued another “illegal, un-American, unconstitutional order” to take away his rights, Trump complained. However, this loses something in the translation, as Trump uses the beautiful spelling “unConstitutional” in the original.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump also attacks the judge's daughter\r\nBut Trump was far from finished: With the “malicious gag order,” this judge was wrongly trying to deprive him of his rights under the First Amendment. And that when everyone in the state knows that “I have done nothing wrong!”\r\nIn the second section of his three-part diatribe, Trump also addressed Merchan's daughter, who allegedly published \"a picture of me behind bars.\" The judge's daughter can share photos of her \"dream\" of \"putting me in prison\" with impunity, Trump said. Maybe the judge would hate him so much because his daughter was making money from her anti-Trump campaign? Then the judge decides against him and at the same time makes his daughter and the company she works for richer and richer. \"How can that be?\"\r\nIn the third part of his suada, Trump asked the judge to declare himself biased without delay. But if the “biased” judge continues to preside over this bogus “case,” it will be “another sad example of our country becoming a banana republic.” Then Trump took the opportunity to once again describe the hush money trial as a “witch hunt.”\r\n\r\nDonald Trump's behavior is extraordinary\r\n\r\nDid Trump violate the speech ban issued by Merchan? Probably not. Because the judge didn't explicitly mention himself. Nevertheless, Trump's behavior is remarkable. Lawyer Nick Akerman also sees it that way. The former Watergate prosecutor said in an interview with CNN that he had never seen anyone show as much “contempt and open hostility” toward the courts as Trump. “This is totally unusual, something like this just doesn’t happen.”\r\nAkerman also gave the simple reason for this: because you are putting yourself in danger. “This is the judge who will sentence you. It's the judge who could send you to prison. So you don't do things like that.\" Trump, Akerman said, was the only person he had ever seen who had done something like that.\r\nTrump, who wants to be re-elected to the White House for the Republicans in the US election in November, is accused in the hush money trial of, among other things, falsifying business documents. He has pleaded not guilty.",

        "article": "Conservative cabinet ministers, look away now: your ‘Portillo moment’ could be on the cards\r\n\r\nTwo mega-polls suggest that the Tories are heading for a defeat more catastrophic than they experienced in 1997. What if they’re right?\r\n\r\nReader, I was there. It was shortly after 3am on 2 May 1997 when the Labour celebrations at the Royal Festival Hall turned from noisy exuberance at the prospect of a landslide election victory to unrestrained delirium about the epic scale of the losses being inflicted on the Tories. It was the result from Enfield Southgate that did it. When Michael Portillo, who had been widely tipped to become the next Conservative leader, was evicted from a seat that had previously looked impregnable, the Labour crowd erupted in visceral chanting of: “Out! Out! Out!” Loathed as the pomaded embodiment of the Tory arrogance and division of that era, he was one of seven cabinet ministers who were culled by the electoral reaper that night.\r\nFor his entertaining blow-by-blow account of events, Brian Cathcart chose the title: Were You Still Up for Portillo? A poll of Channel 4 viewers and Observer readers rated his humiliation “their third favourite moment of the 20th century”, one place ahead of the execution of the Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceaușescu. Mr Portillo later reinvented himself as the pastel-clad presenter of TV travelogues. While he may have put his election-defining expulsion from parliament behind him, it is still seared into Conservative folk memory.\r\nSenior Tories have compelling cause to break out into cold sweats about what will be said in the early hours after the coming general election. Will we be asking one another: Were You Still Up for Rees-Mogg? And Gove? And Shapps? And Hunt? And Cleverly? And Mordaunt? Could folk even be asking: Were You Still Up for Sunak? A recent projection has suggested that things look so dire for the Tories that their leader could be in peril of losing his own seat in North Yorkshire.\r\nThat came from one of two mega-polls that have thickened the miasma of doom enveloping the Conservatives by suggesting they could be heading for a defeat as calamitous, and possibly even more catastrophic, than the one they experienced 27 years ago. You could argue that this is not telling us anything that wasn’t already obvious. Labour has been sustaining a lead of 20 points or so in the poll of polls for the past 18 months. These latest surveys have transfixed frightened Tories for three main reasons. First, because they use unusually large sample sizes and MRP, the snappy acronym for a technique called multilevel regression and post-stratification, to translate the data into a projection of the composition of the next parliament were the country voting tomorrow. Second, the MRP method has had a decent predictive record over recent elections. And third, MRP aims to forecast outcomes seat by seat. It is scary for Tory MPs that their party languishes so far behind in the headline polls; it is even more terrifying to be told that they are individually fated to be felled. The YouGov projection, published last week, has the Tories plunging to just 155 MPs, Labour surging to more than 400, and Sir Keir Starmer enthroned at Number 10 on a Tony Blair-like 154-seat majority. The Survation analysis, commissioned by Best for Britain and published over the Easter weekend, was even more of a bed-wetter for Tories. It projected that they would be crushed to fewer than 100 MPs while Labour would have 468 in the next parliament, resulting in an enormous 286-seat majority.\r\nThere’s a consolation that the prime minister and his people cling to. This is the notion that many voters who are presently saying they are undecided will end up plumping for the Tories come election day. Yet most of the pollsters already factor in an assumption that Don’t Knows who were Conservative supporters in 2019 are more likely to break to the Tories when we get to the crunch. If that assumption is faulty or exaggerated, then the pollsters may not be being too harsh about Tory prospects, but too generous. The possibility that the Conservatives could be staggering towards near annihilation is taken seriously at high levels of government. Talking to a member of the cabinet recently, he remarked, without any prompting from me, that he didn’t find it inconceivable that his party would suffer a fate similar to that which befell Canada’s Progressive Conservative party in 1993. A nine-year stretch in power was brutally terminated when they were reduced to a rump of just two MPs.\r\nPredictions that their party is at risk of an extinction-level election result do not horrify all Tories. There’s one gang who relish and promote these apocalyptic polls. That’s the band, mainly on the right of the party, who are already agitating for the removal of Mr Sunak. They plan to step up their campaign to defenestrate him from Downing Street after the expected evisceration of the Conservatives at May’s local government elections. This mob are undeterred by the argument that the Tories will look utterly absurd if they change leader yet again. Like the frantic gambler at the craps table who is already massively in debt, they reckon that things are so bad for their party that it has nothing left to lose by making one last desperate hurl of the dice.\r\nAll manna from heaven for Labour? If Sir Keir Starmer is truly on course for a super-majority, it would look even more impressive for being such a remarkable turnaround from Labour’s result in 2019, its worst since 1935. Yet predictions of a big win do not trigger elation in the Labour leader and his inner circle. Angsty is a better description of how they feel about these polls. In his war against any hint of complacency, Sir Keir tells colleagues that they should fight as if “we are five points behind”. That’s hard to keep credible when pollsters are telling you that, with a maximum of nine months to go before polling day, you’re in landslide territory. Another anxiety in Labour circles is the feedback loop between polling and the electorate. All the evidence suggests that this will be a “time for a change” election and Britain is firmly resolved to purge itself of Conservative government. That is not the same as being able to say that the country is keen to see Labour installed in power with a colossal parliamentary majority. So Sir Keir’s strategists fret about the impact of polls like these on the intentions of voters who might be leery of Labour unbound.\r\nShould Sir Keir desire the kind of mega-majority being suggested by these polls? It is obviously more appealing to a prime minister to have masses of troops behind him at Westminster rather than trying to manage parliament and pass legislation with a mini-majority. A stonking victory may also improve Labour’s chances of being in power long enough to try to fulfil its leader’s promise to deliver “a decade of national renewal”. It is important, though, for Labour to note that this is by no means guaranteed. The Liberals won a triple-figure landslide majority in 1906, but it melted away in just four years. The 145-seat majority secured by Labour in 1945 crumbled to just five at the 1950 election and the Tories were back in government by 1951.\r\nA Labour super-majority won’t mean an easy life for a Starmer government. It will still have to grapple with a grim inheritance. Having a lot of Labour MPs won’t magically lift the rate of economic growth or instantly repair ravaged public services. Should it stumble, a big-majority Labour government will find it hard to blame anyone else for its failures. One risk to Sir Keir from winning large is that this could raise unrealistic public expectations about how quickly and dramatically Labour can reform and rebuild Britain. Another potential problem is keeping a huge body of Labour MPs content and productive rather than seeing the parliamentary party turn fractious and factional. Politics abhors a vacuum. Big-majority governments have a tendency to generate opposition from within themselves. The back-to-back landslides enjoyed by Tony Blair were marred by the endless and toxic TB-GB conflicts between him and Gordon Brown, his restless chancellor.\r\nMany of the Blair generation, including the man himself, would now say that they wasted time in their early period in office. They were too obsessed with hoarding their landslide and not sufficiently energetic about exploiting it to press on with difficult but vital reforms. By contrast, Margaret Thatcher, though her 1979 majority was much more modest, quickly got cracking with her radical right revolution.\r\nThere’s a moral here for Sir Keir and his putative cabinet. When it comes to majorities, it is not so much the size that counts as what you do with it.",

They could even come staggering back into power\r\n\r\nFor many people reading this, the analogy will seem ludicrous, but hear me out: if the Conservative party was one of your friends, you’d be very worried about them.\r\nYou can maybe imagine it: a privately educated pal from university, perhaps, who seems to have fallen on hard times and bad company. Ten or 15 years ago, they seemed urbane, clever and super-confident. Even if some of it went only skin deep, they professed to be green, socially liberal and culturally switched on. Now, though, they tend to look dishevelled and saggy-eyed. After a few drinks – and sometimes before – they speak an increasingly hysterical language of conspiracy theory and political paranoia. They also seem to be furtively spending some of their time with thugs and bigots: the kind of people whom that great English social commentator Paul Weller once associated with the smell of “pubs, and Wormwood Scrubs, and too many rightwing meetings”.\r\nLast week, the latest election projection from YouGov predicted the Tories’ number of Commons seats plunging from 348 to 155. The party now seems to pin its hopes of avoiding complete wipeout on putting a few refugees on a plane bound for Rwanda – ideally, it seems, in the wake of a showdown with judges in Strasbourg. Meanwhile, Suella Braverman, whose time as home secretary included the insistence that this was her personal “dream”, is about to headline a rightwing gathering in Belgium alongside the authoritarian Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. In a similar spirit, Liz Truss decided to try to escape the disgrace of her lost weekend in 10 Downing Street by calmly standing on a platform while a fellow speaker lauded Tommy Robinson as a “hero”. Giving another signal about who her new allies might be, last week she attended Nigel Farage’s 60th birthday party.\r\nThese things feed a sense of uncontrolled Tory ferment, with Rishi Sunak a hapless observer rather than any kind of effective participant. Over the weekend, the Sunday Telegraph reported that nearly half of Tory councillors think the government is “too leftwing”. The activist website Conservative Post, linked to the high-rolling Tory donor Peter Cruddas, is now urging party members to stop any remaining “liberal centrists” from standing as Tory candidates, and has published a helpful list of what it calls “the first 10” who should go.\r\nBy way of illustrating the kind of politics such a move would assist, the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick – once an insipid Tory journeyman but now seemingly on a mission to become the full-blooded Enoch Powell de nos jours – has proposed an amendment to the government’s criminal justice bill whereby annual crime figures would include “migrant crime league tables”, based on the nationality and asylum status of every offender convicted in English and Welsh courts (according to a report in the Daily Telegraph, the government’s main concern is about the plan’s practicality, “as ministers have no ideological objections to it”). In among this daily carnival of nastiness and attention-seeking – regularly enlivened by noises off about National Trust scones, flags on football kits and the other small change of current Tory politics – sits David Cameron, who once sold himself as the representative of something very different. Sitting at the cabinet table, he must surely wonder what on earth happened while he was away.\r\nNext month, the writer Geoffrey Wheatcroft will bring out a belated and very lucid sequel to his 2005 masterpiece The Strange Death of Tory England, titled Bloody Panico!, in honour of a phrase used by a long-forgotten postwar Conservative MP named Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles. It highlights what Wheatcroft calls “the undoubted degeneration of the party in terms of personnel” and its embrace of a fanaticism that gained huge ground after Cameron opened the way with the 2016 referendum. English Toryism, he says, has always had “many grave vices”, but also a few redeeming upsides: “pragmatism, scepticism, pessimism and sheer common sense”. He goes on: “Those virtues have occasionally deserted the Tories, as in the years before the Great War when Ireland drove them mad. A hundred years later they were driven mad again, by Europe. It was not the fact of Brexit, not even the economic damage it had obviously caused, so much as the political consequences for the Tories, both the party and the Tory press.” Once, he says, Conservatism avoided the kind of “blind reaction and extreme nationalism” that ran riot on the continent: now, ironically, its loudest voices are in increasing accord with the populists who are forecast to take a quarter of all seats at June’s EU parliament elections.\r\nIn the context of the Tories’ apparently inevitable defeat, the state of the UK’s political right might prompt a very understandable burst of schadenfreude. But no one should laugh: the Conservatives’ seemingly unstoppable lurching to the right is actually a grave cause for concern, for a few key reasons. One is to do with the basic functioning of our systems of power, and the fact that governments need to be held to account. Effective opposition, in other words, is a very important job, which an unhinged rabble will not be able to carry out.\r\nBut an even bigger cause for alarm centres on a possibility too easily written off. British politics now moves at a breakneck pace: less than five years ago, let us not forget, the party now apparently on its last legs won an 80-seat Commons majority. The state of politics in many of our neighbouring countries speaks for itself. The Tories’ immediate future, therefore, may not be quite the comical sideshow some people assume.\r\nEven in the event of a Labour landslide, the likely survivors will include Braverman, Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch, with the latter styling herself as a more level-headed kind of Conservative, but she supported Brexit in 2016 and has a long record of culture-war posturing. Regardless of who becomes the next party leader, post-Brexit Toryism is now built around a solid set of factors that will ensure that the most paranoid, belligerent views will remain noisy and untamed: a reactionary activist base, plenty of supportive media outlets and the element personified by Farage – present both inside and outside the party, and set on constantly yanking the Tories even further to the right. If a Labour government hits the skids, therefore, the consequences could be terrifying.\r\nWhich brings me to my final source of anxiety. Keir Starmer’s technocratic approach to politics has obviously worked short-term electoral wonders, but it has also left a space that the re-energised post-Brexit right will sooner or later move to occupy: the one reserved for emotion, stories and narratives about what Britain is. Worse still, in the absence of those things, some Labour people are already filling the gap with some very dangerous messages. Last week, the Daily Express published a piece by Josh Simons, the director of the very influential Labour thinktank Labour Together, about immigration policy – peppered with the kind of tropes that any rightwing Tory would happily endorse. The government, he said, “have not made the average working family better off, just increased our population”. Migrants “should contribute to the pot before they take from it”, and “homes should be built for British citizens before those who live here temporarily”.\r\nHere, perhaps, was a lesson so far unlearned: that no matter how dishevelled and discredited some people may seem, if you parrot their lines, you may yet allow them to recover and come roaring back.",

                "text": "Which brings me to my final source of anxiety. Keir Starmer’s technocratic approach to politics has obviously worked short-term electoral wonders, but it has also left a space that the re-energised post-Brexit right will sooner or later move to occupy: the one reserved for emotion, stories and narratives about what Britain is. Worse still, in the absence of those things, some Labour people are already filling the gap with some very dangerous messages. Last week, the Daily Express published a piece by Josh Simons, the director of the very influential Labour thinktank Labour Together, about immigration policy – peppered with the kind of tropes that any rightwing Tory would happily endorse. The government, he said, “have not made the average working family better off, just increased our population”. Migrants “should contribute to the pot before they take from it”, and “homes should be built for British citizens before those who live here temporarily”.",

        "article": "Amid Israel-Hamas conflict, 'information war' plays out on social media, experts say\n\n\"Online, what speaks powerfully is images,\" one expert said.\n\nIn the wake of Hamas' unprecedented surprise attack inside Israel, a battle is being waged on the streets of Gaza, with guns and tanks following Israel's retaliatory bombing campaign. But at the same time, another clash is happening -- one using tweets and shares.\nTikTokers, Instagram users and others posting online from both sides of the war -- including those witnessing the conflict up close in Gaza -- are battling it out to win the social media war and influence public opinion worldwide, experts told ABC News.\n\"It's particularly relevant in this instance. The military battle with Hamas and Israel is predetermined; Hamas can't defeat the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and [the] IDF can't obliterate Hamas. So, you have a wider battle, let's call it an information war,\" David Patrikarakos, a war correspondent and author of the book \"War in 140 Characters: How Social Media is Shaping Conflict in the Twenty-First Century,\" told ABC News.\nCiting a disparity between pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian social media posts, Max Boot, a military historian and a foreign policy analyst, told ABC News he believes, \"Israel is losing the information war because it's the battle of victimhood.\"\nA recent study by The Washington Post found that the number of pro-Palestinian hashtags used on the TikTok, Instagram and Facebook platforms has dwarfed pro-Israeli hashtags since the Hamas terror group attacked Israel on Oct. 7. Though, TikTok said those hashtag numbers lacked context, since many social media users come from the Middle East and Southeast Asia. On Facebook, The Washington Post found that the #freepalestine hashtag was used 39 times more than the #standwithisrael hashtag and 26 times more on Instagram.\nMore than 1,200 people have been killed and over 6,900 others injured in Israel, according to Israeli officials, and Hamas is believed to be holding more than 230 people hostage. Israel retaliated with missile strikes and a ground incursion that have left more than 14,000 dead in Gaza and 35,000 others injured, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\nThe terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7 was swift and brutal and horrified the world. But with ongoing Israeli retaliatory attacks in Gaza being played out on social media since then, day after day -- in videos that often can't be verified -- the narrative has changed, according to experts.\n\"... The sympathy of a lot people in the world has shifted away from Israelis,\" Boot said, adding that the IDF holding press conferences is very different than seeing the aftermath of the attacks in Gaza.\n\"It's more visceral to show suffering and to express outrage over suffering rather than listen to someone at a press conference,\" Boot said of the social media disparity. \"Israel can just go and say whatever it wants in a press conference, but basically, if you are explaining, you are losing. Online, what speaks powerfully is images.\"\n\n\"Emotional power\" of social media\nOn the Israeli side, the IDF has daily press conferences where officials lay out the news from the front to international journalists, their spokespeople do interviews across news networks, and the foreign ministry pushes out an infographic campaign on social media platforms. Meanwhile, flyers of kidnapped Israelis believed to be held hostage by Hamas are plastered on walls of cities around the world.\nFor its part, Hamas holds weekly press conferences on the fourth floor of an office building in Beirut, Lebanon. A Hamas spokesperson delivers talking points mostly to an audience of international journalists, even sometimes giving answers in English to the Western press.\nBut while Israel and Hamas are conducting dueling press conferences at podiums inside conference rooms, some of the citizens of Gaza and Israel are using a different method to get their voices heard: TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, dispatching to the world some of the most visceral and engaging content from the frontlines, Patrikarakos told ABC News.\n\"It has huge emotional power,\" Patrikarakos said, referring to social media posts from Gazan journalists. \"On one side, you have this young girl telling a deeply personal story, and on other the side, you have a middle-aged man in a uniform at a podium giving statistics, and it's not going to compete.\"\n\n\"The sky no longer gives me hope\"\nDaily video diaries by social media users about life in a war zone are flooding social media feeds. These accounts have some of the most harrowing descriptions of war and also some of the more mundane, detailing everyday aspects of living in an area under siege.\nOne Gaza-based journalist, Plestia Alaqad, recently posted to her 3.6 million Instagram followers a video of the blue sky above her filling with smoke from a dropped bomb.\n\"The sky always gives me hope,\" the 22-year-old wrote in the post, which garnered more than 200,000 likes. \"I love watching the clouds and their shapes, and I enjoy watching sunsets and sunrises as well ... but now when I look at the sky all I can see is smoke and darkness ... the sky no longer gives me hope.\"\nAlaqad often posts firsthand accounts of the war along with videos showing the aftermath of bombings, some shot from the balcony of her apartment in Gaza. In another recent post on TikTok, the sounds of loud explosions could be heard outside her apartment.\n\"We're inside the house right now and literally we can't breathe,\" Alaqad said in the post. She then went to her balcony and recorded the thick smoke filling the sky. \"No view. You can't see anything,\" she said.\nWhen ABC News attempted to reach Alaqad for an interview, she did not respond. In one of her recent posts, she said, her videos speak for themselves.\n\nA \"messenger\" who says he's debunking misinformation\nOn the Israeli side, Adiel Cohen -- a social media content creator and influencer, and an enlisted IDF reservist currently on the frontlines on Israel's northern border -- told ABC News his number of followers has doubled since the war began.\n\"When it comes to views, likes and engagement and even the amount of pieces of content put out there, we are largely outnumbered,\" the 25-year-old Cohen said, referring to pro-Israel and pro-Jewish content compared to pro-Palestinian social media content.\nCohen recently posted an emotional video from inside Kfar Aza in southern Israel, where numerous residents were killed on Oct. 7 when Hamas terrorists stormed through a security fence at the edge of the kibbutz, shooting indiscriminately at residents, setting fire to homes and killing entire families.\nIn the video, a tearful Cohen described how one woman was in a bomb shelter that was set on fire by the terrorists to force her out.\nCohen -- a college student who boasts more than 51,000 followers on Instagram, 65,000 on TikTok and more than 12,000 on X -- said he sees himself as a pro-Israeli \"messenger\" debunking misinformation that goes around on social media.\n\"I'm not here to read out messages put out by the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs or something, or the IDF spokespeople,\" Cohen said. \"I'm here to speak of my experience as an Israeli Jew living here through the conflict, suffering from terror, suffering from rocket attacks for years, telling my story as much as I can, as much as the security allows me to as a soldier, as a student who left everything behind and was drafted to a war that was imposed on me.\"\nCohen said he also believes Israel is losing the social media information war.\n\"It's just that there are a lot less of us [Israelis] and there are a lot more of those who claim to be pro-Palestine, and the images from Gaza to the regular person who doesn't understand the context of what's going on are a lot more horrifying,\" Cohen said. \"It also has to do with the popular narrative nowadays that Israel has the upper hand and Palestinians are the underdog in this conflict. And for a lot of people, it's almost impossible when they live abroad, when they live in America, to understand the nuance, that it's not about Israel versus the Palestinians because the war is not against Palestinians, it's against Hamas.\"\nThe unfiltered social media posts from inside Gaza have become a vital source of information for the world as Egypt and Israel control entry into the Gaza Strip, not allowing many foreign reporters to enter independently. The battlefield inside Gaza is mostly off-limits to major international news organizations. An ABC News crew was recently allowed into Gaza while embedded with an IDF unit.\nInside Gaza, citizen journalists, filmmakers, mothers, poets, writers, students and photographers posting on social media say they've seen their engagement exponentially grow as the fighting rages on.\n\"The impact is huge. That's the power of the iPhone, arming people to be media outlets for the democratization of information,\" Valerie Wirtschafter, a fellow from the Brookings Institute studying the impact of emerging technologies, told ABC News. \"At its core, to be able to document and share is really, really important, especially in places that journalists don't have access to because everyday citizens are living there. The challenge is that there is such a high volume of information now that the footage gets muddled with other videos and it's leading to an overarching sense of mistrust.\"\n\n\"Endless violence\"\nGaza photojournalist Motaz Azaiza recently posted to his more than 14.8 million Instagram followers a photo of two Palestinian children lying on a hospital gurney, their heads and limbs bandaged and their faces bloodied. \"Children in Gaza have been witnessing endless violence by the Israeli forces,\" Azaiza wrote in the post, which garnered more than 840,000 likes. \"These children do not deserve what they are currently experiencing.\"\nIn another recent post, Azaiza is seen running through the dust of a recently bombed Gaza neighborhood, horns blaring in the background. \"It was closer to my grandma's house, an airstrike near here!\" he wrote in the post, which was viewed more than 700,000 times.\nHind Khoudary, a Palestinian journalist inside Gaza, has more than 825,000 followers on Instagram, gaining thousands of them after the war started, and that number continues to grow. In a recent post on Instagram that generated more than 100,000 likes, she appealed for assistance in getting flak jackets and protective clothing so she can continue reporting in the region. In a Nov. 8 post, she showed a home reduced to a pile of rubble, saying as she panned the camera over the destruction, \"There are still 24 family members who are buried under this rubble.\"\nPatrikarakos said that under Hamas, Gaza has been a \"hugely patriarchal society.\"\n\"If you were to pick someone who should be the most powerless person in that society, it would be a young female civilian. But now, because of the power of her posts, she [Khoudary] became an incredibly powerful voice for the Palestinian point of view,\" Patrikarakos said.\nBut as Patrikarakos pointed out, there is a greater context to these posts, saying the ultimate tragedy of this war is that the suffering of the citizens of Gaza is being used by Hamas to set their narrative to the world.\n\"Hamas needs influencers to highlight the suffering of its own people because Hamas doesn't have an Air Force. So, it needs the influencers,\" Patrikarakos said. \"You see the more Israel destroys Gaza, the more battlefield victories it has, the less the sympathy of the world because Hamas has a strategy to brandish its own people's bodies to the world. It's the goal. They can't defeat Israel with airpower, so they stack the media with images of dead Gazans and hope that the world sees.\"\nSince its Oct. 7 attack, Hamas has said in multiple statements it was expecting retaliation by Israel, but that it would be the price the group is willing to pay for change for the Palestinian people. \"Will we have to pay a price? Yes, and we are ready to pay it,\" Ghazi Hamad, a member of the Hamas politburo, told Beirut's LBCI Lebanon News TV station in an interview that aired Oct. 24. \"We are called a nation of martyrs, and we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.\"\nThe impact of this narrative could have consequences for how the war plays out eventually and the international pressure on Israel, Boot told ABC News.\n\"Israel doesn't want to alienate the Western world,\" Boot said. \"I think this is something Hamas understands. I think Hamas has made a judgment that creating more Palestinian casualties will lead to its own benefit.\"\nBen Jensen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, D.C., said it's important for the public to use a skeptical eye when taking a close look at all the aspects that go into shaping a narrative of the war on both sides -- including social media posts, the videos and the press conferences.\n\"Take a close look at those emotionally laden stories. You can't just accept it, you should ask, is that really true? What's the other side? What is their perspective?\" said Jensen, who authored the book \"Information at War: Military Innovation, Battle Networks, and the Future of Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\"It's important that we do it because if we don't do it soon, we are literally going to be tearing ourselves apart jacked up on emotion. TikTok is the ultimate emotional drug,\" Jensen added.",

        "article": "Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary: ‘There isn’t enough cooking oil in the world to power one day of green aviation’\n\nThe explosive airline boss with a big bonus looming sees the need for climate action – but points out ships and cars are big emitters too\n\nEven in an age of astronomical executive pay, few bosses would be indifferent to the idea of gaining another €100m. And even fewer billionaires might regularly be seen lugging their own cardboard props into the cramped lift of a London hotel before a press conference.\nBut Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary, who is in line for a payout that could dwarf anything yet seen in aviation, has long given the strong impression of not being bothered about the megabonus soon heading his way. The airline’s chief executive will receive the payout, agreed in 2019, if the company hits long-term profit targets that are looking increasingly achievable.\nThis stems partly, of course, from O’Leary being a significant investor in the airline. Given his 3.9% shareholding, the potential €98m (£84m) bonus becomes just a fraction of his spiralling on-paper wealth: a 50% rise in the shares since November already makes his stake in Ryanair several hundred million euros fatter.\nIt is possibly still not enough for O’Leary. He will concede only that aviation has made him “reasonably wealthy”. A billionaire, no? “Probably,” he says. “The Ryanair share price goes up and down.”\nBut he also appears determined to keep himself and his family grounded. At least one holiday a year is dedicated to an “educational tour”, and on this year’s agenda was a visit to concentration camps.\n“Children of people who are reasonably wealthy and have a very entitled view of the world that comes from social media – they should go and see Auschwitz and realise that bad things happen, he says. “Everyone should be aware and never forget the atrocities. No matter how hard you think your life is – go and see what happened to the Jews in the second world war.”\nIt can still come as something of a surprise to see O’Leary touch on serious subjects in public, after decades of press conference stunts, unbridled hip-shooting pronouncements and sweary tirades against those he deems incompetent.\nThis autumn, his favourite targets have been the UK’s air traffic controllers, Nats: he made repeated calls for the head of “overpaid” chief executive Martin Rolfe (salary: £477,000), after the system failure that briefly halted flights in late August. The last O’Leary press conference was an extended, full-blown denunciation of Nats, the Civil Aviation Authority and their boards of directors.\nBut once the rant is over, O’Leary is affable and entertaining, expressing opinions at pace – and if you don’t like them, he has others you might not like either.\nThe man who famously joked that the “best thing we can do with environmentalists is shoot them” says he is now concerned by the impacts of climate change. “As one of the larger farmers in Ireland, we’ve had a very bad summer this year, so yes. Look, I am generally a believer that technology and human ingenuity will overcome the concerns about climate change. I think we do have to decarbonise, and I have absolutely no doubt that we will not decarbonise because we tax people more.”\nHe’s unclear on how else that can happen. Ryanair has huge numbers of new planes on order which are more efficient per passenger, but this will mean ever more airline seats are available.\nPeople will “absolutely not” stop flying because of concerns about climate change, argues O’Leary, who was recently hit with cream pies by climate protesters in Brussels. He adds: “I always feel somewhat aggrieved that the airlines are the poster child for climate change, when airlines account for 2% of CO2 emissions. Shipping accounts for 5%, but nobody ever posts a picture of a boat chugging out of a harbour and goes: ‘There you go: the globe is warming up’.”\nBut he says sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), the great hope for many airlines, are a con: “They’re a wheeze. Unless governments get in behind the production and sourcing of sustainable aviation fuels – and they’re only going to come from, ultimately, the oil majors, the only ones who are going to make them – I don’t see where we will get the supply in the volumes we need. You want everybody running around collecting fucking cooking oil? There isn’t enough cooking oil in the world to power more than one day’s aviation.”\nRyanair has signed deals with oil majors to supply up to 9.5% of its fuel needs in SAF by 2030. “But we have no idea that they’ll be able to make those kinds of volumes.”\nTo help aviation, he says, governments should reform his bete noire: air traffic control. “If you could eliminate ATC delays and inefficient routings, you would reduce fuel consumption by another 20-25%.”\nFor O’Leary, cars should be the priority: “If you can move that to an electric fleet … It’s the only way we’re going to get anywhere close to net zero by 2050.”\nWhatever flak people direct at O’Leary’s airline, and his no-prisoners policy on additional fees, few could accuse him of being incompetent. Lowering costs, including charges from airports and suppliers, in order to keep fares low has been the bedrock of Ryanair’s phenomenal growth from Irish also-ran to Europe’s biggest airline.\nYet, he says, he fell into aviation by accident, once he eventually knuckled down after finding freedom at university: “I was at a Jesuit boarding school for six years. So we spent the first two years chasing girls and drinking beer, and then after that I wanted to go off in business and make money.”\nStarting off in KPMG as a tax accountant, he first invested in convenience stores, which was “the only way you could make money quickly in Ireland in those days. Because they were cash businesses, you kind of jacked up the turnover and extracted cash, then went and bought property with the surplus.”\nA crucial turning point came at KPMG in the 1980s when he advised one Tony Ryan, owner of an aviation leasing business, on his tax affairs and left to start working for him. Back then, the new airline “was bleeding – all the income he was getting out of the leasing company was disappearing down the black hole that was Ryanair”.\nO’Leary had been going to shut it down – but then was dispatched to the US to see Herb Kelleher, founder of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. He returned to implement Southwest’s stripped-back model at Ryanair just as aviation across Europe was deregulating and low-cost travel was opening up. “We got there first. And managed to stay ahead of them all.”",

        "article": "Veteran homelessness made harder by climate change\n\nOn a Friday afternoon in early September, the temperature stood at 94 degrees at Windsor Veterans Village just north of Santa Rosa, California — sweet relief from earlier in the week, when the mercury soared to 114 degrees. The sky looked hazy with smoke from the Mosquito Fire, which had already consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest in the eastern part of the state.\nThis particular fire burned more than 100 miles from Santa Rosa, a bucolic city in the heart of California’s wine country. But over the last five years, multiple wildfires have impacted Santa Rosa and the surrounding countryside. In 2017, a string of fires was estimated to have caused as much as $7 billion of damage in the city, destroying thousands of homes.\nThis pattern has played out across California — 12 of the state’s 20 largest wildfires have burned in the last five years. While California has mismanaged its forests, which contributes to the increase in wildfires, researchers agree that rising global temperatures make fires both more frequent and harder to control. Thousands of Californians have evacuated their homes in recent years; many have been permanently displaced. Even in places untouched by fire itself, smoke and particulate matter choke out clean air.\n“It’s scary. Scary. Very scary,” says Kenneth Gray, a Navy veteran at Windsor Veterans Village who has been without permanent shelter during previous wildfires. “You don’t know if you’re going to be running for your life or not. The only other experience I can relate that to is being on the flight deck of a carrier during flight ops.”\nWindsor Veterans Village offers apartments to veterans experiencing homelessness. In 2020, more than a quarter of the country’s unhoused population — and more than 30% of all unhoused veterans — lived in California. Other states — like Texas, which in recent years has been battered by hurricanes, severe heat waves, and a historic deep freeze last winter — also have their share of unhoused veterans. As climate change wreaks havoc on the weather in these places, the effects on veterans and others living outside can be catastrophic.\n“Disasters definitely have a disproportionate effect on those that are marginalized,” says Eric Samuels, who runs the Texas Homeless Network, which works to end homelessness in the state.\nExtreme weather is on the rise around the world. While being displaced by a tornado or flooded out in a hurricane can be devastating for anyone, for those living without guaranteed shelter, these events can make daily life effectively impossible — and can delay access to needed resources and support.\nUnhoused people often find themselves on the frontlines of the effects of fires, floods, and extreme temperatures as weather changes around the world. In recent years, damaging weather and related natural disasters have increased in both frequency and severity, driven by climate change. Hurricanes are getting stronger. Storms are dropping more rain. Sea level rise contributes to higher storm surges, increasing flooding. In the western part of the country, a “megadrought” — the worst in more than a thousand years — continues. The worsening California wildfire seasons have been spurred in part by rising temperatures.\nVeterans are disproportionately represented among people experiencing homelessness, even after more than a decade of improvement. And while unhoused veterans may have access to resources that other people experiencing homelessness do not, they also tend to have more complex physical and mental health conditions that can make bouncing back from disaster even more difficult.\n“Veterans are still coping with the aftermath of the fires,” says Mary Haynes, who leads the Northern California branch of Nation’s Finest, which runs Windsor Veterans Village. “For the unsheltered, it’s very, very difficult.”\n\n‘It would be considered a mass casualty event’\nIn the United States, veterans make up about 7% of the population but 13% of people experiencing homelessness. That’s a drastic improvement from a decade ago. Concerted efforts to identify and house veterans have cut veteran homelessness by more than half in the last 12 years. But the pandemic and high rates of inflation have increased economic insecurity, and even veterans with housing can be at risk of homelessness: Nearly 13% of housed veterans report income at or below 150% of the poverty line. According to research by the Bob Woodruff Foundation, half of all veterans between the ages of 25 and 54 say they have less than $4,000 in their bank account.\nVeterans are overrepresented among the homeless population for a number of reasons, says Blake Harris, who runs the mental health department for the Texas Veterans Commission. Veterans may be more likely to experience trauma, which correlates with homelessness. And they have higher rates of traumatic brain injuries, which can be a risk factor. Veterans experiencing homelessness also tend to be older, Harris says.\n“They may have fewer supports in terms of family and friends and other folks that can also lend a hand,” Harris says. “They also have barriers to being employed. The kind of overarching thing is the amplification of all the risk factors that are there for your general civilian unsheltered person.”\nIn general, unhoused people receive less health care than housed people. While people living outside struggle with many of the same ailments as the overall population, those problems are often worse, says Tipu Khan, a physician who works with unhoused people in Southern California.\n“Some of the bread-and-butter stuff is still an issue,” Khan says, pointing to chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. “What I think tend to be more prominent in this population is those issues tend to be a little bit more uncontrolled. So we tend to see more complications of the diabetes, of the high blood pressure, because they don’t have access to regular care.”\nIn severe heat, like parts of this summer when more than half the U.S. population was under a heat warning or advisory, unhoused people face higher rates of heatstroke and kidney failure — severe dehydration can lead to decreased kidney function. Heat and fatigue exacerbate chronic conditions, and heat-related deaths have risen in recent years in the United States. In 2021, in Maricopa County, Arizona, where temperatures often reach into the triple digits, 130 unhoused people died from heat-related causes — about double the number who died in 2019.\n“If 130 homeless people were dying in any other way, it would be considered a mass casualty event,” Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington, told The Associated Press.\nSimilarly, in extreme cold — such as the winter storms that swept across Texas in February 2021, pushing temperatures to single digits in some parts of the state — unsheltered people can bear the brunt of the chill. Across the state, at least 246 people died because of the storms, most of them from exposure.\nHomelessness is worsening in the United States, and severe weather affects everyone without stable housing. But veterans provide a microcosm for looking at the crisis — and is a population that can be particularly impacted by these weather events. Disasters and severe weather events can retraumatize some veterans. Harris has worked with veterans who served in the Middle East who struggle during heat waves.\n“We’ve had some experience working with veterans that will say, ‘You know it’s really hot out there,’” Harris says. “It can kind of bring them back to some of the experiences they may have gone through in the desert. So it can be triggering in and of itself.”\nVeterans may also be more reluctant to accept help or move into shelters, even during emergencies. “They don’t trust the system often, because the system has failed them,” Khan says. “So when they hear, ‘Hey, we’re with the county hospital,’ I think that’s a turn-off, initially.”\nEven absent those additional factors, moving inside to safety, when possible, may be more difficult for unhoused people than for those with houses. People who live outside often rely on pets for protection and companionship, but many homeless shelters don’t accept animals. And leaving behind belongings can be devastating and destabilizing. When an evacuation order comes down, people who live inside can often pack some essentials to take with them when they go — leaving the rest of their belongings inside their homes and hoping for the best. People experiencing homelessness, by contrast, typically do not have a safe place to leave their belongings, and taking everything with them to a shelter often isn’t an option.\n“They’re carrying everything valuable to them with them,” Harris says. “So a lot of folks are almost root-bound to the spots that they find, where all their stuff is with them. … How do you pack up your entire life and take it with you?”\n\n‘It multiplies everything by a factor of a thousand’\nIn 2017, when Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm, it dropped more than four feet of rain in parts of the state and spawned dozens of tornadoes. About 32,000 people were displaced, and more than 210,000 people requested disaster assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n“When Harvey hit, we had thousands of people who were in shelters,” Samuels says. “They sent people to San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, Fort Worth. We even had some people go to Amarillo. So automatically, those agencies in those cities are doubled or tripled in terms of capacity.”\nDuring a natural disaster, the systems people experiencing homelessness rely on for services can be overloaded with an influx of people who previously did not need support. First responders, hospitals, shelters, and community organizations can be overwhelmed, leaving unhoused people with fewer places to turn for food, shelter, or medical care.\n“Case managers are used to dealing with disasters,” Samuels says. “But these large-scale disasters that happen to multiple households and individuals — it just multiplies everything by a factor of a thousand.”\nOrganizations that serve homeless populations must prepare for worst-case scenarios, says June Gin, a Veterans Affairs researcher who studies disaster preparedness in homeless services organizations. When an emergency arises, local officials often offer guidance aimed at people with stable housing.\n“Everybody tells us you have to have three days’ worth of food and water stored,” Gin says. “[Unhoused people] obviously can’t store anything, barely.”\nProviders should also think through the situations that will be particularly hard for people living outside or in unstable situations. In California, for instance, frequent triple-digit heat waves and wildfires encroaching on urban areas pose newer threats.\n“I would say the challenge is that maybe they haven’t always been recognized as disasters,” Gin says. “I think that there were a lot of people who sort of thought, Well, we’re preparing for earthquakes.”\nIn this case, unhoused veterans may have an advantage. VA-funded organizations that provide transitional housing for veterans must have updated disaster plans. And VA often has resources to support veterans after an emergency. “It’s great to have the VA in your corner,” Gin says. In fact, she says, disasters can provide an opportunity to connect veterans to resources or benefits they didn’t know about or have access to before an emergency.\nBut that cuts both ways, Harris says.\n“There are a lot of resources for veterans through the VA, and then through state partners, and then through community organizations who are invested in serving those who have served,” he says. “However, there is also, at the same time, a misconception among many folks that, ‘Well, they’re taken care of by the VA,’ or, ‘The VA takes care of all their needs.’ And that’s not necessarily the case.”\nUltimately, stable housing for veterans provides the best long-term solution. At Windsor Veterans Village, Robert, a Navy veteran who lived outside for 27 years in Northern California before learning he qualified for an apartment last year, says living outside in extreme conditions is never easy.\n“It’s hard in the wintertime,” he says. “If you don’t have blankets, you can’t stay warm. Shower facilities are practically nonexistent.” During heat waves, following medical advice — stay hydrated, stay cool — isn’t necessarily possible. “There’s not always water available. There’s not always shade available. Especially in that kind of heat, because everybody’s running for shade.”\nWhen the temperatures reached the triple digits earlier in the week, Robert says, for the first time, he was able to hunker down in his own space. His new place stays so cool that he turned on the air conditioning for only a couple of hours.\nHe spent the heat wave cleaning his apartment.",

The new note, “Laudate Deum,” meaning Praise God, was published weeks before the U.N. climate meeting.\n\nThe Pope blasted the Western lifestyle\nThe 12-page letter reads, “If we consider that emissions per individual in the United States are about two times greater than those of individuals living in China and about seven times greater than the average of the poorest countries, we can state that a broad change in the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model would have a significant long-term impact.”\n\nThe Pope spoke about “irreversible” harm\nPope Francis challenged the U.N. to strengthen the agreement they reached in Paris in 2015 and warned about the “irreversible” harm people have already created. The Pope wrote, “We are now unable to halt the enormous damage we have caused. We barely have time to prevent even more tragic damage.”\n\nThe letter aimed to alarms\nPope Francis explained that the second, updated letter was necessary because “our responses have not been adequate, while the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point.”\n\nPeople are not reacting fast enough\nThe Pope further wrote, “The necessary transition towards clean energy sources such as wind and solar energy, and the abandonment of fossil fuels, is not progressing at the necessary speed.”\n\nPope Francis on the next U.N. meeting\n“The United Arab Emirates will host the next Conference of the Parties (COP28). It is a country of the Persian Gulf known as a great exporter of fossil fuels, although it has made significant investments in renewable energy sources,” the letter shared.\n\nThe Pope’s warning\nHe continued, “Meanwhile, gas and oil companies are planning new projects there, with the aim of further increasing their production. To say that there is nothing to hope for would be suicidal, for it would mean exposing all humanity, especially the poorest, to the worst impacts of climate change.”\n\nThe Pope on technology\nPope Francis warned that technology won’t solve a climate crisis that’s only getting worse and mentioned that “technological advances that make it possible to absorb or capture (heat-trapping) gas emissions” have “proved promising.”\n\nThe responsibility\nThe Pope wrote, “What is being asked of us is nothing other than a certain responsibility for the legacy we will leave behind once we pass from this world.”\n\nAccurate but hopeless\nU.S. climate scientist Carlos Martinez, a Catholic who leads a multifaith committee for the American Meteorological Society, told A.P. that it appears like a report card for Earth and the people, and “it appears from the language that he would give students a D, like a D-. Because there has been some progress, but it’s not where it needs to be.”\n\nMartinez continued\nMartinez added, “He does not mince his words as to the state of the environment and its impacts on people and communities.” Martinez shared how the message was scientifically accurate but offered little or no hope.\n\nHuman suffering\nEvangelical Environmental Network President Jessica Moerman, a climate scientist turned pastor, said, “To have a global religious leader like Pope Francis putting climate action in terms of defending life is huge.” Moerman, the board member of the National Association of Evangelicals, added this was telling people that climate change “is causing human suffering and that as people of faith committed to defending life, this is something we can no longer ignore.”",

        "article": "The year 2023 has proven that climate change is not coming – it is here and things are spiraling out of control\n\nPoliticians often talk about climate change being a problem for future generations to solve, but many scientists say now is the time to act and that the climate has already changed – it is not a distant scenario. Never before has the devastating impact of global warming been more evident than in 2023, the hottest year in human history.\nBut if this trend continues, 2023 could be one of the coolest years in recent memory. In other words, if we don’t change our relationship with fossil fuels, things will get much worse. In the meantime, we can expect the pile of broken records to continue to grow. Here are some of the key reasons why 2023 became a pivotal year in our anthropogenic downward spiral, but given our ever-changing baselines, it’s probably not an anomaly.\n\nThe summer of 2023 was the hottest summer on record.\nWhen United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the world in September that the summer of 2023 had been the hottest summer in history, he did so in unmistakably vivid and dramatic language.\n“Our planet has just endured a sweltering season – the hottest summer on record. “The climate breakdown has begun,” Guterres declared, later adding: “The dog days of summer don’t just bark, they bite.”\nThis year will see “a new global temperature record,” which “underscores the fact that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels and cause carbon pollution.” In fact, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the June to August 2023 period saw an average global temperature of about 16.77 °C (62.19 °F), an increase of 0.66 °C (33.19 °F). F) compared to the previous year corresponds to normal average.\nThis extreme heat is not only miserable, it can also be very deadly, essentially triggering mass casualties, exacerbating wildfires, driving up healthcare costs and damaging critical infrastructure, all at a time when the… People have to run at full speed. if they even have it. Additionally, an estimated 90 percent of humanity is expected to suffer even more extreme heat in the coming years.\n\nThe world is expected to warm by 1.4°C in 2023\nLast month the WMO released another terrible statistic: The The planet’s temperature is expected to rise 1.4º Celsius (2.5º Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. In addition, the organization’s preliminary state of the global climate confirms that 2023 will be the hottest year on record (instead of 2016).\n“Greenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record breaking. Sea level rise is record-breaking. Sea ice in Antarctica is at record low levels,” WMO Secretary-General Peterri Taalas said while discussing the report.\nThis figure is particularly worrying because experts believe that if the Earth warms by 1.5 degrees Celsius, a series of irreversible feedback loops will occur, including the collapse of the Gulf Stream current in the Atlantic Ocean and rapid melting from the Arctic and Antarctic to Greenland.\n\nThere will be a new global temperature record in 2023\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average global surface temperature from January to October 2023 was the highest ever recorded in the 174-year history since these readings were taken. Notably, global surface temperature during this period reached a staggering 1.13 °C (2.03 °F) higher than the 1901–2000 average of 14.1 °C (57.4 °F). The previous record, set between January and October 2016, was 0.08 °C (0.14 °F). The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) estimates that there is over 99% chance that 2023 will be the warmest year in history.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the January to October 2023 period was the warmest on record, with a temperature 1.44 °C (2.59 °F) above average. In the Southern Hemisphere, the January-October 2023 period was also the warmest on record, with average temperatures 0.81 °C (1.46 °F) above average.\n“I expect these records to be broken on a regular basis due to ongoing climate change. But I didn’t expect them to be broken in such large quantities.”\n\nThe heat content of the oceans will also set a new record\nWhen the salon contacted Dr. Addressing Dr. Michael E. Mann, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, he listed among the most important climate change news in 2023 that this year “will see a new global surface temperature record.” which “underscores the fact that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels and create carbon pollution.”\nMann also pointed to another worrying development – namely the “heat content of the oceans, which is also set to set a new record.” He argued that this is “of equal importance because warming oceans are helping to destabilize ice shelves and fuel more powerful hurricanes and tropical cyclones.”\nActually, loudly NOAAOctober 2023 was the seventh consecutive month of record high monthly global sea surface temperatures. Already in August NASA announced that “the ocean has a fever,” with NASA oceanographer Josh Willis explaining that the two main factors behind the record highs are “an El Niño forming in the Pacific, on top of long-term global warming.” This caused ocean temperatures to nearly rise everywhere steadily for a century.”\n\nThe melting ice also suffered major damage\nAccording to WMO, Antarctic sea ice extent reached an all-time low in 2023, at least in terms of what scientists have known since the beginning of the satellite age in 1979. From June onwards, the sea ice extent reached a record low and the annual maximum in September 2023, the total area was 16.96 million km2, around 1.5 million km2 below the average from 1991 to 2020. The authors drew particular attention to Switzerland, where “the “Glaciers have lost around 10% of their remaining volume in the last two years.” Glaciers in North America and elsewhere in the European Alps were hit.\n“The global sea ice minimum observed earlier this year underscores the larger trend toward melting ice, warming polar regions, and destabilizing ice sheets,” Mann wrote to Salon.\n\nBottom line: 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record\nAs the WMO announced at COP28, the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, 2023 is “almost certain” to be the hottest year on record once December 31 passes. As Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, explained in Dubai: “It is a deafening cacophony of broken records.”\nThe experts who spoke to Salon agree with this assessment.\n“The record monthly global mean temperature records this summer are unusual,” Michael Wehner, senior scientist in the Computational Research Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told Salon by email. “I expect these records to be broken on a regular basis due to ongoing climate change. But I didn’t expect them to be broken in such large quantities. So that’s scientifically interesting.”\nWehner added: “Still, I am more concerned about the regular but increasing record-breaking global average temperatures we have seen over the last two decades or so. This shows that we have not slowed down climate change.”\nMann repeated this observation.\n“The record temperatures of 2023 highlight how ongoing human-caused warming will continue to be accompanied by natural climate fluctuations – in this case [weather patterns like] El Niño – to exceed ever new thresholds, including increasingly prolonged periods when global surface temperatures exceed 1.5°C and brief moments when we even exceed 2°C,” Mann told Salon. “It is a warning that if we fail to dramatically reduce carbon emissions in the coming years, we will consistently exceed these thresholds in a decade or two.”",

        "article": "COP28 roadshow: Nigeria’s gains in push for new climate action\n\nThe Federal Government is counting its gains from COP28, after parties sought transition away from fossil fuels, operationalised loss and damage, mobilised more than $85billion in new financial commitments, which are crucial actions that will help to shape a better, cleaner world with greater equitable prosperity, writes CHINEDUM UWAEGBULAM.\n\nNigeria was on the path of history recently when the 28th Conference of Parties (COP28) concluded with 198 parties endorsing a landmark agreement “The UAE Consensus” that sets out an ambitious climate agenda to keep 1.5°C within reach.\nAmong other things, the UAE Consensus calls on parties to transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero, encourages them to submit economy-wide Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), including a new specific target to triple renewables, double energy efficiency by 2030, and build momentum towards a new architecture for climate finance.\nThe consensus follows a year of inclusive diplomatic engagements and two weeks of intense negotiations, where parties agreed on the operationalisation of the loss and damage, totaling more than $700 million. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) received a boost to its second replenishment with six countries, with total pledges now standing at a record $12.8 billion from 31 countries.\nEight donor governments also announced new commitments to the Least Developed Countries Fund and Special Climate Change Fund totaling more than $174 million, while new pledges, totaling nearly $188 million were made to the Adaptation Fund. These financial pledges are far short of the trillions eventually needed to support developing countries with clean energy transitions, implementing their national climate plans and adaptation efforts.\nNigeria was not left out in the bargain, as the President Bola Tinubu-led delegation also made significant gains, which was enumerated by the Information Minister, Mohammed Idris.\nNigeria and Germany signed a performance agreement on the implementation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) to improve electricity supply in the country.\nTinubu hosted a high-level meeting with stakeholders and investors on the Nigeria Carbon Market and the Electric Buses Rollout Programme, where the Nigeria Carbon Market Activation Plan, co-chaired by the Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Zacch Adedeji, and the Director-General of the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC), Dr. Dahiru Salisu, were in attendance.\nAlso, heads of several Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) entered into agreements with their counterparts in the UAE. For instance, the NNPC sealed two deals to commercialise the country’s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for domestic and international markets to ensure that the country earns the much-needed revenue from its abundant gas assets.\nMoreover, after signing a strategic partnership agreement between themselves on research and development projects aimed at enhancing the quality, reliability, and affordability of rural electrification solutions, the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), signed an MOU with Shenzhen Technology Development Company of China, through its subsidiary, Lemi Renewable Energy Limited. This agreement is targeted at the development and establishment of a $150 million Lithium Battery Manufacturing and Processing Factory in Nigeria.\nDespite these achievements, delegates’ representation threw up a massive controversy. Unsurprisingly, the UAE has the largest-ever registered delegation of any country, with 4,409 badges. This was followed by Brazil with 3,081 and then China and Nigeria, who have both issued 1,411 badges. Other that followed in toe were Indonesia with 1,229, Japan with 1,067, and Turkey with 1,045.\nIdris, however, countered the claim of an over-bloated delegation, saying that the country’s official delegation was 422 delegates, which is a far cry from the figure peddled at the summit.\nIf the figures released by the minister are anything to go, the country would have spent over N1, 644,423,014, comprising N1, 097, 200,000 for economy flight @ N2.6 million return tickets for each delegate, and N547, 223, 014 for accommodation @N1, 296, 737 for 13 nights per person, excluding feeding and other logistics on COP28.\nThe expenses are expected to be higher since some of the delegates are ministers and senior government officials, who have privileges of first class/business tickets, or luxury apartments.\nFor experts and civil society groups, Nigeria has not been taking advantage of its position as the largest economy in Africa, even as its approaches to COPs over the years have been questionable.\nFor the Director, Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF), Nnimmo Bassey, the country’s delegation to Dubai was unduly large mainly because the COP was approached as a roadshow for investment drive judging from the number of memoranda of agreement signed at the Nigerian Pavilion during three COPs.\n“Unfortunately, treating the COP as a trade fair misses the point of the multilateral space, which is primarily for serious negotiations. Side deals weaken the hands of vulnerable nations as they cannot vigorously confront the polluters with demands for justice over the resolution. This is why the COPs have weakened considerations of the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) principle and now operate on the NDCs- an approach that negates the requirements of binding emissions reduction by polluting nations, but allows for convenience as a major determinant of action.”\nAccording to Bassey, Nigeria’s gains or losses at COP28 can best be assessed by looking at what turned out in favour of the African continent. “In that sense, we recall that Africa went to the COP28 primarily with the outcome of the African Climate Summit, which was held in Nairobi. The key expectations of the continent included the drive for sufficient finance for the needed energy transition and the operationalising of the Loss and Damage Fund.\n“The leaders resolved to aim for ‘green development’, an oxymoron, and green industrialisation. They also went with the mindset of having bountiful critical green mineral reserves and vast swathes of lands and forests to serve as carbon sinks and to generate carbon credits.\n“Those basic expectations are recipes for the entrenchment of green colonialism – an extractivist approach that benefits polluters and compounds the problems confronting the victims of climate change,” he said\nHe continued: “Nigeria’s position as a staunch defender of OPEC’s position not to agree to a fossil fuels phase-out was also not laudable. However, it can be said that with Nigeria’s government ‘gained’ from the COP outcome agreement to only transition from fossil fuels, while promoting unnamed transition energy resources, which will definitely include fossil gas.\n“This specious gain will see Nigeria digging for more oil and gas for export, as is the trend across the continent. We note that over 85 per cent of the infrastructure on the continent is installed for exports showing that they are not extracted to meet the energy needs of the people on the continent.”\nBassey said that Nigeria needs a bottom-up national stock-take on voluntary actions to draw up what is needed to address the impacts at home, regionally, and globally. This should include scenarios for embarking on adaptation and mitigation measures with deep consideration of the complex roots of the crisis using both historical and current lenses.\n“Nigeria must realise that the transition from fossil fuels has begun no matter what we may think. The days of fossil fuels are numbered. Rather than talk of decarbonising, the world will soon be speaking of depetrolising. Within the coming decades, the global North will halt the production of internal combustion engines and Africa risks becoming the cemetery for such automobiles,” he said.\nHe stated that the COP cannot be allowed to continue as a carbon trade fair where lands and forests are auctioned as carbon sinks to permit polluting nations and corporations to continue with reckless exploitation and neocolonial grabbing of resources.\nFor the Chairman of Nigeria Environment Study/Action Team (NEST), Prof. Chinedu Nwajiuba, the gains come in different forms. “Nigerians, working in and outside the country, various government and non-government activists involved with the subject of climate change and related matters, showcased what they have been doing. Interested parties at the global level interacted with participants at this level, and some partnerships and linkages were created.\n“We have a new government and officials may have been interested in getting involved, acquiring some knowledge, exploring some of the promised financial resources, and such interests. Some international bodies and agencies are interested in implementing programmes and projects in Nigeria were able to establish relevant relationships with Nigeria-based partners. Most of these will usually imply financial inflows into the country.\n“I also know of critical stakeholders, who should be at the COP but were not, while their peers in other countries were there. One of such is the universities. At COPs, most well-known universities from all over the world come to showcase their researches and inventions, and market such to investors, as well as meet with funders of researches and innovations. Nigeria’s universities have been missing on that,” said Nwajiuba, a former vice-chancellor of Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State.\nHe advised that Nigeria should always be at the COP because “we belong to the UN systems and signatory to all the relevant agreements. The government-funded delegates may not be as many as was reported in 2023, but certainly, the COP should not be what few Nigerians should attend. I want to see Nigerian universities and more youths attending.”\nThe Executive Secretary of HEDA Resource Centre, Sulaimon Arigbabu, said that Nigeria could gain much more from multilateral negotiations and opportunities. “The country is still not taking good advantage of many factors that could work for us, such as the number of our official delegations and unofficial participants.’’Our weight is not felt in the negotiations as much as could be,”\nFor many years, activists have been at the forefront of advocating that the Nigerian government should use its unlimited quota to enable the participation of many more Nigerians who could make positive input into the country’s general experience at the COPs or similar conferences. So, this year, what people termed as over-bloated delegations were citizens from the civil society, academia, faith, entertainment, and business communities, who took advantage of the government’s facilitation to attend the conference and pay their bills.\nHe called for the audit of official COP delegates. “From the over 422-man delegation that the FG claimed to have sponsored, how many of them are experts who are negotiating for us? What are their competencies? Who are they, and how were they selected? That process is not open, and these people are not known to stakeholders. Therefore, public accountability is difficult to achieve. There is still a lot of patronage and ambiguity about the selection process. The problem is not the size of our delegation. It is the lack of a strategic plan to maximise the benefits of such for the interest of the country,” Arigbabu said.\nHe said: “We must do internal stock-taking, knowledge and information sharing before the conferences. Currently, just one meeting hurriedly put together before the COP is ineffective. We need to know our negotiators; what are Nigeria’s positions on critical issues? We need to have better engagement and plan that every Nigerian participating at the COP, whether government sponsored or not, have a stake, can access guidance and information on the agenda promoted by Africa and Nigeria in particular.”",

        "article": "All Climatologists Do Not Agree on Global Warming\n\nHave key scientific journals become a monolithic industry of fear-peddling, hardwired to an unprecedented degree with confirmation bias? It appears so, as they cavalierly promote only the most catastrophic sounding “climate change” models at the direct expense of objective science and the careers of dissident researchers.\nConsider climatologist Dr. Patrick T. Brown, co-director of the Climate and Energy Team at the Breakthrough Institute and adjunct faculty member and lecturer in the Energy Policy and Climate Program at Johns Hopkins. In an article published by “The Free Press” in early September, Brown noted: While climate change is an important factor affecting wildfires over many parts of the world, it isn’t close to the only factor that deserves our sole focus. So why does the press focus so intently on climate change as the root cause? Perhaps for the same reasons I just did in an academic paper about wildfires in Nature, one of the world’s most prestigious journals: it fits a simple storyline that rewards the person telling it.\nThe above-noted academic paper—entitled “Climate warming increases extreme daily wildfire growth risk in California”—focuses exclusively on how climate change affects extreme wildfire behavior.\n“I knew not to try to quantify key aspects other than climate change in my research because it would dilute the story that prestigious journals like Nature and its rival, Science, want to tell,” Brown added.\nHe went on to say that since such high-profile “scientific” journals are increasingly rigid “gatekeepers” for academic success, these journals’ editors have made it unmistakably clear, in terms of what opinions they’ll accept or reject, that they only want “preapproved narratives—even when those narratives come at the expense of broader knowledge for society.”\nBrown also observed: Climate science has become less about understanding the complexities of the world and more about serving as a kind of Cassandra, urgently warning the public about the dangers of climate change. However understandable this instinct may be, it distorts a great deal of climate science research, misinforms the public, and, most importantly, makes practical solutions more difficult to achieve.\nLibertarian-leaning ABC News veteran John Stossel, writing for the New York Post last month, spoke to climatologist Judith A. Curry, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She concurred that scientists who want a successful career “have an incentive to exaggerate risk to pursue ‘fame and fortune’.”\nShe should know, since, at one time, she was among those bellowing about the “climate change” bogeyman that’s supposedly about to engulf us all, via either super floods or crushing droughts, unless we ditch backyard cookouts, swap our illicit gas-chuggers for all-electric vehicles, and eat bugs. The media was rather cozy with Curry then. She had dutifully published a study suggesting that “climate change” was causing an alleged dramatic increase in the intensity of hurricanes.\n“We found that the percent of category 4 and 5 hurricanes had doubled,” she told Stossel, adding that the media relayed her hurricane claims uncritically. She also noted that the climate alarmist establishment realized that the future of knighting the winners and crucifying the losers in terms of scientific discourse and career advancement belonged to those who tied any and all extreme weather events to “global warming.”\nYet another scientific figure whose experiences drive home even further the fact that today’s climate science is unscientific in its merciless savaging of anything other than gloomy, nebulous perspectives is Nobel Laureate Dr. John Clauser (Physics 2022).\nAccording to a recent report published in Newsweek, Clauser “was to present a seminar on climate models to the International Monetary Fund,” but the talk was “summarily cancelled.” Reportedly, IMF Independent Evaluation Office Director Pablo Moreno had read literature for a July 25 online talk by Clauser and immediately nixed the event.\nWhat was Clauser’s chief transgression? He has suggested that carbon dioxide, which the mainstream scientific autocracy sees as perhaps the most dangerous among the “greenhouse gases,” is beneficial to society. Clauser evidently did not mention that CO2 comprises a smidgen of the atmosphere, with the National Energy and Technology Laboratory noting: Carbon dioxide occurs naturally in small amounts [about 0.04%] in the Earth’s atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a minor part of the air that humans breathe. It is also a byproduct of our body’s metabolism and is subsequently exhaled from the lungs.\nAll this sidesteps the broader view that significant manmade “climate change” does exist, but it comes in the form of long-term cloud-seeding programs that go back decades in the records of the UN’s World Meteorological Organization and in other weather-modification permits submitted to the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation as well as other local and regional governments.\nYet, nightly weather reports never acknowledge that public and private entities are monkeying with the weather in this fashion in the U.S. and around the world. The politically driven “climate change” narrative is all the scientific and media establishment seek to promote.",

        "article": "Two Climate Change Wrongs Don't Make a Right\n\nIn his State of the Union address, President Obama launched his latest campaign in the war of ideas over global warming and what to do about it. This time, instead of a mandatory cap on greenhouse gas emissions, he proposes that Congress enact a clean energy standard though just what will count as clean remains fuzzy.\nMany Republicans will doubtless again respond by challenging the science that shows that greenhouse gas emissions could cause harmful climate change. Were such challenges directed at poking holes in the often hyped claims of green advocates, they would serve the public interest. But Senator James Inhofe and many other Republicans go much farther, claiming that manmade climate change is a huge scientific hoax and that greenhouse gas emissions pose no risk.\nHoax, really? Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish Nobel laureate chemist, first described the greenhouse effect in 1896. Science, then, has long known that carbon dioxide and some other naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere cause Earth to be about 30 degrees C warmer than it otherwise would be. Mankind, by burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, is adding to the atmospheres stock of warming gases. If that process continues, all else being equal, simple logic tells us that the planet will warm further. Warming is highly likely to affect rainfall, clouds, ice cover, and much else.\nThat said, the size, timing, and economic impacts of manmade emissions remain unclear. Some climate system responses to the build-up of greenhouse gases are known to dampen the extent of warming and some to amplify it. The balance between the two responses remains under debate. In other words, a given increment of emissions could produce a lot of change or only a little.\nThus, climate science provides at best hazy guidance. Even so, some scientists are calling for stringent curbs on emissions. Their demands largely ignore the need for policy to factor in economic and political realities that lie outside the scope of climate science and that are far beyond the ken of most climate scientists. These scientists, moreover, have been quite lax about distinguishing which of their statements rest solely on science and which voice their personal policy preferences.\nMr. Obama, in order to cloak his proposals in the mantel of science, is happy to go along. But noting that greenhouse gas emissions do imply some risk of harmful climate change is a far cry from concluding that the Obama clean energy standard is in the U.S. national interest. For one thing, a ton of carbon dioxide has the same effect on climate regardless of where it is emitted; therefore, halting manmade warming requires cutting emissions globally. In fact, the U.S. accounts for only about a fifth of the worlds total, and, as emissions from China, India, Brazil, and other developing countries surge massively, the U.S. share of the total is falling fast.\nThe developing countries, meanwhile, have staunchly rejected all pleas to accept slower economic growth as the price of limiting their emissions. They know that climate change poses a threat, but they judge that rapid economic growth is the best armor against the ill effects that it might someday bring.\nMr. Obama would do well to ask himself if this insight might also apply to the U.S. A rich endowment of human and physical capital is a key to being able to adjust to climate change at low cost. Buying emission cuts at too dear a price will reduce our resources for adapting to climate change, much of which is unavoidable given the choices of the developing countries. Conversely, if Mr. Obama still nurtures hopes of persuading China, India, and others to curb their emissions, using U.S. emission cuts as a bargaining chip would offer more hope than would handing them over for free.\nInstead, the president is trying again for the climate version of unilateral disarmament. One can only hope that Republicans have the votes to reject his new scheme. As to an intelligent debate about how best to cope with the risks of climate change, that, clearly, must await another day.",

        "article": "Don’t Lose Sleep Over Climate Change Encyclical\n\nIt’s official. Progressives love Pope Francis. Their magazines, from Think Progress to Mother Jones, are abuzz with excitement in light of the recent rumor that the pope is going to issue an encyclical on climate change sometime in the next few months.\nAs a politically conservative American Catholic, I’m expected to throw a fit about this, and I hate to disappoint people. So even granting that this is still just a rumor, I’ll go ahead and admit that I would not welcome an encyclical that made carbon emissions a much-discussed topic. It would smack of intellectual faddism, and it’s always depressing to feel that Church authorities are more focused on trendy social controversies than on the fundamental business of saving souls.\nHaving said that, I’m not going to lose any sleep over a (possible) Church document on climate change. Nor should you.\nAs a political conservative, I care somewhat about political issues such as this. But as a Catholic (which is much more important), I mainly care about fundamental Church teachings on faith and morals. Climate change is only very distantly relevant to any of these, so nothing the Holy Father says about it is likely to muddy doctrinal waters to any great extent. The deposit of faith is safe. Frankly, we should probably be grateful if the talking heads chatter a lot about Catholicism and climate change. After the recent, literally scandalous debates over divorce and family issues, it might be a relief to see the Holy Father devoting his energies to environmental concerns, rather than stirring up doubt and division over central doctrinal or moral questions.\nI understand of course why progressives are so excited over an anticipated row between the Roman Pontiff and their conservative enemies. But there’s really no reason why this should happen, because when it comes to climate change, none of the controversial questions are of the sort that the Holy Father could definitively answer anyway.\nMost of the time, the figures tarred as “climate deniers” are simply people who insist on parsing the relevant ecological, economic and prudential questions with a carefulness that runs contrary to the zealous, unthinking activism that liberals would prefer to foster. Progressives love to promote a narrative wherein they are on the side of science, while conservatives (and religious people especially) are sticking their heads in the sand and wishing away the mountains of empirical evidence that run contrary to their views. On top of that, climate-change panic harmonizes with many secularists’ sense of drama and impending doom. We might see it as the apocalyptic side of the progressive’s tendency to “immanentize the eschaton.” Liberal sensitivities are most appeased when they feel that political forces are about to usher us all into a new, shining utopia … provided nature doesn’t obliterate us first. We may achieve the paradise of the perfect political order, but only if we can escape being damned for the sin of inventing civilization in the first place.\nClimate change, in other words, fits nicely with the pseudo-religious sensibilities of progressives. This is why people who understand nothing about the science will lobby aggressively for measures to reduce carbon emissions: because “science says so,” but also because it feels intuitively right to them that humans are on the verge of destroying themselves through environmental folly. Meanwhile, within the scientific community itself there is an army of public rent-seekers (not to mention providers of alternative energy, and Democratic politicians) who have everything to lose and nothing to gain from a relaxation of public concern over climate change. They are quite happy to stoke their acolytes into an activist frenzy. Taking all this together, there is plenty of reason to be cautious about jumping on the “science is settled” panic-wagon.\nOf course it doesn’t follow from this that climate change isn’t a real concern. It probably is, to some extent. But when we dig into the details, it turns out that “climate change” is a far more complex issue than environmental activists like to admit. Even identifying what the relevant questions are with respect to climate change is a challenging task. Answering those questions is even more difficult.\nLet’s start by considering the most basic of questions. Is climate change a real thing? On the most basic level, the answer is clearly “yes.” No intelligent person is actually a “climate denier,” because we all understand that it is entirely normal for the earth’s climate to change. Climate stasis would be the real aberration; climate change is the norm. The fact that it’s normal of course doesn’t mean that it’s not cause for concern. Changes in climate can cause all sorts of problems for human populations. But we shouldn’t act as though changes in climate represent some unique or unprecedented situation. Human civilizations have always had to adapt to changing weather patterns.\nOur harbingers of climatory doom are of course not satisfied with this answer. They suggest that the climate is changing more than it normally does, or ought to, or more than it would but for the adverse effects of human civilization. This is certainly possible, but the issue is hard to settle because of course we really don’t know what our climate would look like without human civilization. Would Hurricane Haiyan still have hit the Philippines in a cleaner-energy world? Would it have been as bad as it was? Any answer we might give to that question will be highly speculative. And for all we know, there may have been other terrible natural disasters that didn’t happen, owing to human impacts on climate. Once again, it would be unreasonable to dismiss entirely the possibility that humans are impacting their climate in an undesirable way. But we also should not forget that weather has always been unpredictable, changeable, and occasionally deadly.\nEven insofar as we can identify a likely connection between human activities (most especially carbon emissions) and climate change, further questions remain. Are the changes in climate negative for humans? And if so, are the economic costs of any recommended policy changes worth the climatory benefits?\nI suspect that Pope Francis’ remarks, assuming he does offer some, will center around two points. First, he will likely offer some general observations about the importance of exercising good stewardship over the natural world. And second, he will remark on the injustice of the wealthy continuing to live in comfort at the expense of the “most vulnerable.” This is a favorite theme of his, and climate change may seem to fit the narrative since developed nations have higher “carbon footprints,” while poorer nations have greater difficulty adjusting to climatory change. But before concluding that there is a clear moral imperative to restrict the use of fossil fuels, we should keep in mind that the “most vulnerable” will also suffer from rising energy costs. Without cheap fossil fuels, many more people will be hungry and cold. Abundant energy also tends to fuel job growth, which the Holy Father has highlighted in the past as a vital concern for modern societies.\nIt’s reasonable for the Holy Father to use his moral authority to address ethical issues relating to climate change. However, he cannot claim infallibility, or even great expertise, in all the relevant empirical, economic and prudential questions that play into the controversies surrounding climate change. There is no reason for this issue to precipitate a standoff between the Holy Father and American conservatives. We should save our worrying for more important matters.",

Kennedy Jr. reiterated his free market-based approach to environmentalism, warning that the typical communist Democrat position on climate change is much different.\nInstead of embracing a top-down totalitarian approach that benefits \"mega-billionaires,\" Kennedy says he supports a free market, capitalism-based approach to environmental protection.\n\"Climate issues and pollution issues are being exploited by, you know, the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates and all of these big, you know, mega billionaires,\" Kennedy stated.\n\"The same way that COVID was exploited to use it as an excuse to clamp down top-down totalitarian controls on society and then to give us engineering solutions.\"\nKennedy would go on to reveal that these same exploitative mega-billionaires are all embedded within the environmental regulatory agencies that are imposing climate tyranny on the masses.\n\"And if you look closely, as it turns out, the guys who are promoting those engineering solutions are the people who own the IPS, the patents for those solutions,\" he said.\n\"It's a way they've given climate chaos a bad name because people now see that it's just another crisis that's being used to strip by the wealth of the poor and to enrich billionaires.\"\n\nRFK Jr.'s positions are widely popular among Americans from both sides of the political aisle\nFor the past 40 years, Kennedy has maintained the same positions on policies related to climate and engineering. His speeches going back to the 1980s show that he has always supported \"free market capitalism\" as the solution to environmental problems.\nWith an agenda like this, Kennedy might as well be running as a Republican. In many ways, though, it is better that he is running as a Democrat because Kennedy's positions used to be more the norm among Democrats, who have since been co-opted by far-left extremism.\nBecause Kennedy's positions make sense, though, and are likely to be widely supported by Americans of all political stripes, the establishment will probably keep him hidden away and out of view as much and for as long as possible, just like they did to Ron Paul and others in the past who rocked the boat politically speaking.\n\"RFK Jr. is correct in saying that they want to use climate change as a way to usher in totalitarian control,\" one commenter wrote.\n\"It's never been about 'saving the planet' and it's not about clean air or water,\" responded another. \"It IS a scam to keep people from having a better life.\"\n\"The eco-fascists will force you into a tiny clown car, a 200 sq. ft. tiny home for your family, a 900-calorie daily diet, a government-controlled thermostat and only one child per family and travel by ox cart.

They will live the lifestyles of the rich and famous with luxury yachts, stretch limos and Lear jets, multiple 10,000 sq. ft. mansions on huge 1,000-acre estates. They will manufacture ANY crises to push their agenda. 'We can run the WORLD and your LIFE better than you.

        "article": "The End Of The Climate Change Hoax Is Coming: The 'Green New Deal' Is Another Step Towards Totalitarianism That Will End Up On The Trash Heap Of History \n\nYet The 'Crazy Mazies' Ignore The Facts To Blindly Push The Globalists Agenda \n\nThe “elite” that are in positions of power in our country have decided to make a final push on climate change before being debunked in the future. The man-hater from Hawaii, Mazie Hirono, stated in the past week that the Green New Deal is recognition that climate change is happening and that we should not stick our heads in the sand. She has described President Trump and his minions as knowing zero about the subject and that they deny the \"science\" behind climate change.\nSince the subject has gone from global cooling to global warming, to climate change, it proves that those who are pushing the globalist agenda are the ones who profit from instilling fear in the world population. Looking to move the globalist agenda forward through intimidation and indoctrination are being used to force the program on the people who look to the talking points with skepticism.\nGlobal warming talking points are inundating the country to the point where we now have low information liberal women telling us that they are so afraid that they can not see any reason to have children. Over the last 150 years, there has been global warming. Accepted by many scientists although the reason why is in dispute. Many climatologists and others in the climate change field agree that the climate and the global warming era we are in is regulated a great deal by the sun's activity. The solar cycles over the past 60 years have been higher than average for the 1150 year period data collection period.\nThe period of high solar activity in the 1970-1990 period is the cause of slightly rising temperatures. In the past 19 years with the decrease of solar activity, the temperatures have stabilized. The next cycles show a lack of sunspot activity called a \"solar minimum\" which will lead to cooler temperatures. Any sane climatologist must admit that solar energy input is more important than driving an SUV or pick up truck. Solar activity has been and will be more of a driving force on our climate than any globalist agenda they continue to lie to the people about.\nThey seem to think that they and they alone, by using governments to legislate the people back to the stone age can control nature. If they are so well versed on how to control the climate, why can’t they control hurricanes, or earthquakes or any other natural events that cause such damage to the Earth?\nIn 1992, Democratic Senator Tim Worth said: \"We have got to ride the global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.\"\nMikhail Gorbachev in 1996 : \"The threat of environmental crisis will be the international disaster key to unlock the New World Order.\"\nOur own State Department in 1992 demanded a global warming treaty even if there was no scientific evidence. Globalists have turned the global warming \"science\" into a state-sponsored corrupt religion to be used to bludgeon the world population to subjugate the community to the agenda of global governance.\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez and the other Climate fear mongers are nothing new, it has been going on since at least the 1950s as I have written about before and will continue using false facts and bought and paid for \"scientists\" and “celebrities” like Bill Nye the Science guy who never has been a reliable source of facts. It has gone so far that Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has put forward legislation to attempt to use the RICO Act for organizations, companies and people with who disagree with the faulty science of climate change.\nThe Green New Deal, which is nothing more than a socialist wish list, rants on about the 97% consensus among scientists. This has been thoroughly debunked before. A peer reviewed study by Organizational Studies has shown that only 36% of geoscientists and engineers believe that human caused climate change is true. A strong majority of those involved in the study of over a thousand responses believe that nature is responsible for the climate changes. Even the Wall Street Journal has called the Green New Deal being based on faulty science. In the words from the Wall Street Journal: “A large and growing number of distinguished scientists and engineers do not agree that drastic action on global warming are needed.”\nGeologist Ian Palmer : “Climate change is a natural phenomenon. It has been going on for millions of years.”\nPhysicist Thomas Sheahan: “The science is NOT settled at all and it would be a great disservice to children to indoctrinate them with one currently-fashionable theory.\"\nDr. Will Happer, Princeton University Physicist and appointed to set up the Presidential Committee on Climate Change: “You should not let yourself be deceived by those who claim you are opposing “science”. Science has been badly hurt by the global warming cult.”\nUNIPCC Tom Tripp: “Despite what you may have heard in the media, there is nothing like a consensus of scientific opinion that climate change is a problem.”\n35Year Senior Research Scientist for NASA Dr.Leonard Weinstein: “Any reasonable scientific analysis must conclude that the basic theory is wrong. The Earth will always heal itself. Climate is beyond our power to control. Earth doesn't care about governments or legislation. You can find much actual global warming in present-day observations. Climate change is a matter of geologic time, something the earth routinely does on its own.”\nNobel Prize for Physics winner Dr. Robert B. Laughlin and a Research Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory: \"The jig is up. The whole thing is a fraud. Perhaps what has doomed the Climategate fraudsters the most was their brazenness in fudging the data.”\nEven the Russians are waking up to the lies of climate change. The head of the geomagnetic laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences has said: \"Hundreds of billions of dollars have been wasted with the attempt of imposing an Anthropogenic Global Warming theory that is not supported by physical world evidence. AGW has been forcefully imposed by a barrage of scare stories and indoctrination that begins in elementary school textbooks.\"\nResearch Chemist William C. Gilbert: “The dysfunctional nature of the climate sciences is nothing short of a scandal. Science is too important for our society to be misused in the way it has been done within the climate science community. The global warming establishment has actively suppressed research results presented by researchers that do not comply with the dogma of the IPCC.”\nAtmospheric Physicist Dr, John Reed who has worked with Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific And Industrial Research Organization: “We maintain there is no reason whatsoever to worry about man-made climate change because there is no valid evidence that such a thing is happening.”\nClimate Statistics Professor Dr. Caleb Rossiter of American University and an Obama Liberal in every sense of the word is now being shunned by the Democrat Party for being a climate skeptic. Once his climate skepticism becomes news in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in May 2014, he was terminated from his fellowship at the liberal Institute for Policy Studies after 23 years. He called the Nobel given to Al Gore the worst Nobel Prize since Henry Kissinger. Al Gore, along with Obama vilified people who disagreed on climate change and took steps like those against Dr. Rossiter to ruin lives and assure that publications would not publish and disagreement with those in power.\nDr. Rossiter explained that Al Gore was supported by the progressive socialists in the party because they want to move away from an industrial society to a post-industrial, non-fossil fuel, post corporate society.It has been made clear that those pushing the false science of climate change from Congress to corporations will continue to maintain a zero tolerance policy in regards to climate skeptics. They will not debate nor even recognize that there may be those who read real facts concerning climate change and have a different point of view.\nSo, in an effort to ignore the facts as they are Crazy Mazie has declared that it is settled and those who are too ignorant to agree have their heads in the sand. Can you explain why these scientists mentioned above and many others do not deserve to be heard? Can you explain why those scientists that are ramming through climate change are allowed to manipulate facts and figures and put forth lies that lead to debacles like the Green New Deal? It is nothing more than a progressive socialist agenda that is one further step to the totalitarian power that the socialist demand and will be destroyed and thrown on the ash heap of history like the rest of socialism.",

        "article": "The Humanitarian Pause Is a Chance to Pull Back From a Mindless War\n\nThe extended hostage exchange offers the opportunity to move from war to cease-fire to negotiations.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, smarting from intense global criticism of his near uncritical support for Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza, wants credit for the current humanitarian pause that is allowing an exchange of hostages held by Hamas for prisoners held by Israel. In a statement on Monday, the president said, “I have remained deeply engaged over the last few days to ensure that this deal—brokered and sustained through extensive U.S. mediation and diplomacy—can continue to deliver results.”\nIt’s very difficult to praise Biden—especially since he’s resisted calls for a cease-fire. The push for prioritizing the release of the hostages came largely through political pressure from the families of Israeli hostages, who have been far more critical of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government than Biden has ever dared to be. But politicians are geared to responding to praise. if the path to peace requires giving Biden a pat on the back,, then one must grudgingly agree compliment him for this welcome development.\nIn truth, the humanitarian pause is just about the only good news to come out of Israel/Palestine since the current hostilities started with the Hamas massacre of October 7. We can all rejoice in the release of the Israeli hostages (whose capture was a war crime) and Palestinian prisoners (who were detained in a system that violates international law).\nEven better news is that the parties involved in the negotiation are trying to build on it. \nAs CNN reports: Hamas is pushing to enact a clause in the original arrangement that would see extra days of pauses in Israeli strikes in return for the freeing of each group of 10 hostages. The Israeli cabinet has discussed the idea and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Biden in a call Sunday an extension would be welcome, his office said in a statement. And the United States and Qatar—the two critical intermediaries in the deal—are seeking to use the momentum of the pause to create a foundation for a more permanent end to the fighting that could see more hostages freed and civilians shielded in Gaza.\nIt’s now possible for the first time since October 7 to imagine a path to a better future, one where the humanitarian pause extends to a full hostage release and lasting cease-fire, which in turn creates the conditions for a negotiated settlement (including Biden’s oft-stated goal since October 7 of resuming a push for a two-state solution). This scenario remains very unlikely—but it at least seems within the realm of possibility. It’s both a goal that activists can push for and a reasonable measurement that Biden can be judged against.\nThe humanitarian pause also offers Israel and the United States an opportunity to reflect on the fact that the military strategy Israel has pursued since October 7 is completely mindless: This has been a war of retribution against the civilian population of Gaza that makes no strategic sense and offers no path to genuine security for Israel (leaving aside the immense immorality of the slaughter). Some of the most devastating criticisms of Israel’s strategy have come not from the anti-war left but from the American national security establishment in respectable and staid institutions like the Rand Corporation (a think tank that serves the Pentagon) and publications like Foreign Affairs.\nThese critiques note that the October 7 attack was a massive intelligence failure that discredited existing Israeli strategy, which had assumed that the military threat of Hamas had been contained by a mixture of Iron Dome protection and diplomatic outreach to Arab autocrats (in the process of being codified in the Abraham Accords). Netanyahu’s government assumed the Palestinian question could be safely sidelined for the indefinite future. The atrocities of October 7 demonstrated the bankruptcy of this strategy.\nActing out of shock, Netanyahu’s government then reverted to the familiar tactic of proving its deterrence capability by unleashing the full fury of Israel’s military on Gaza. This is the strategy known as “mowing the lawn.”\nRaphael S. Cohen, a director of strategy and doctrine at the Rand Corporation, offers this succinct account of “mowing the lawn”—which he calls “mowing the grass”: Palestinians, frustrated by the state of the enclave, turn to the likes of Hamas for, if nothing else, vengeance against Israel; Israel imposes restrictions such as the blockade on Gaza, citing security concerns; living conditions in Gaza deteriorate further, and discontent builds; Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and others capitalize on the discontent and attack Israel; and Israel responds by “mowing the grass”—killing the perpetrators along with some number of civilians, buying at best a few years of relative peace and fueling further long-term radicalization. And so the cycle continues ad infinitum.\nCohen adds that this strategy is based on “hubris” and has already been shown not to work: Israel’s mowing-the-grass strategy finally failed spectacularly on October 7. The Hamas attack underscored just how little control Israel has over Gaza. It was not just an intelligence failure and an operational failure but also a more sweeping strategic failure. The core premise behind Israel’s entire approach was proved catastrophically wrong in one morning.\nWriting in Foreign Affairs, Joost Hiltermann, a program director at the International Crisis Group, notes that Israel’s recent attack on Gaza has no good exit strategy. As Hiltermann observes, Israel so far has produced only a military response—to be clear, a devastating one—without a discernible endgame. In its fury and its pain, Israel has struck out not just at Hamas but at the entire Gazan population as well. It may soon find that it is not only incapable of achieving its stated goal of destroying Hamas’s military capability and governance of Gaza but will also be stuck with reoccupying Gaza and ruling directly over its newly homeless, desperate, and very angry population.\nMeanwhile, the cost of the civilian carnage in Gaza is increasingly becoming visible. The New York Times reported on Saturday, “While wartime death tolls will never be exact, experts say that even a conservative reading of the casualty figures reported from Gaza shows that the pace of death during Israel’s campaign has few precedents in this century. People are being killed in Gaza more quickly, they say, than in even the deadliest moments of U.S.-led attacks in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, which were themselves widely criticized by human rights groups.” The Times estimates that of the more than 14,000 people killed in Gaza, at least 69 percent (or 10,000 people) have been women and children. At this rate, achieving Israel’s stated goal of destroying the estimated 30,000 Hamas fighters would entail hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths—assuming that Hamas doesn’t recruit new members as a result of the killings.\nIsraeli officials, when speaking to Secretary of State Antony Blinken have compared what they are doing in Gaza to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This, to be clear, is from people trying to justify their actions.\nWriting in Foreign Affairs, Matt Duss and Nancy Okail, both at the Center for International Policy, have recommended ways the Biden administration can build on the humanitarian pause and jump-start negotiations for a two-state solution. Their suggestions are eminently sensible—but they would require a president far more willing to aggressively challenge Israel on issues like the settlements than Joe Biden has ever shown himself to be. Yet as improbable as negotiations might seem at the moment, what is the alternative?\nIsrael’s war is a humanitarian disaster and has no strategic logic behind it. America’s position in the world is sinking as a result of Biden’s “bear hug” strategy of acting as Netanyahu’s willing assistant. The humanitarian pause offers a rare chance for both Biden and Netanyahu to pull back from the brink. This is the moment more than ever for activists to ramp up the pressure—not just for a cease-fire but for a negotiated settlement.\n",

        "article": "Pope Francis, a darling of the social justice-obsessed left, is not shy when it comes to expressing his thoughts on climate change.\n\nCatholic Church also persecuted Galileo for insisting the Earth revolves around the sun\n\nPope Francis, a darling of the social justice-obsessed left, is not shy when it comes to expressing his thoughts on climate change.\nIn 2015, he penned a 184-page encyclical in which he stated: “Climate change is a global problem with grave implications. … It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.”\nInterestingly, Francis’ 2015 encyclical, which reads more like a policy document than a religious text, came just before the highly touted U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris. Yes, the very conference in which the Paris climate accords were negotiated.\nAlso of interest: Shortly after Francis’ climate change opus was released, several so-called experts associated with international organizations dedicated to combating climate change came out and praised him, because, of course, the pope is a climate science expert.\nHere are a couple of their responses.\nAchim Steiner, then-executive director of the U.N. Environment Program: The United Nations “welcomes Pope Francis’ unambiguous call to action in the face of global environmental degradation and climate change. This encyclical is a clarion call that resonates not only with Catholics, but with all of the Earth’s peoples. Science and religion are aligned on this matter: The time to act is now.”\nThen-U.N. Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres: “Pope Francis’ encyclical underscores the moral imperative for urgent action on climate change to lift the planet’s most vulnerable populations, protect development, and spur responsible growth. This clarion call should guide the world towards a strong and durable universal climate agreement in Paris at the end of this year. Coupled with the economic imperative, the moral imperative leaves no doubt that we must act on climate change now.”\nGee, I wonder if the United Nations and other global institutions devoted to peddling the falsehood that climate change is an existential threat are aware of the irony involved with mingling religion and science.\nOnce upon a time, the Catholic Church persecuted Galileo for insisting that the Earth revolves around the sun. The Catholic Church also instituted the Inquisition. When it comes to science, the Catholic Church does not have the best track record.\nBut this has not stopped the current leader of the Catholic Church, which has 1.2 billion members, from engaging in the climate change debate, despite his utter foolishness on the topic.\nIn his most recent attempt to cement his climate change bona fides, Pope Francis released an apostolic exhortation titled “To All People of Good Will on the Climate Crisis,” in which he states: “Despite all attempts to deny, conceal, gloss over or relativize the issue, the signs of climate change are here and increasingly evident. No one can ignore the fact that in recent years we have witnessed extreme weather phenomena, frequent periods of unusual heat, drought and other cries of protest on the part of the earth that are only a few palpable expressions of a silent disease that affects everyone.”\nHe also proclaims that “the world in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point” and “the necessary transition towards clean energy sources such as wind and solar energy, and the abandonment of fossil fuels, is not progressing at the necessary speed.”\nWhat’s more, he lamented “the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the Western model,” and singled out the United States for being the worst emitter of carbon dioxide while giving China a pass.\nIn reality, as we climate realists well know, the idea that climate change represents an existential threat to our existence is downright absurd. For millions of years, the climate has changed. As the record shows, there have been fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature going back billions of years, way before humans harnessed the ability to use fossil fossils to generate power.\nMoreover, while Francis chides the “Western lifestyle,” he conveniently ignores that Western society, the advent of fossil fuels, and free-market capitalism have lifted billions from poverty while inventing technologies and developing medical breakthroughs that have made the entire world better off. And is Francis unaware or simply overlooking the fact that the United States has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions substantially over the past 30 years while countries like China and Russia have increased theirs?\nPut simply, Pope Francis is wrong regarding all things concerning climate change. Still, I can’t help but wonder if he is being used as a pawn by those who benefit from touting the climate change lie, seeing as how he is the leader of one of the world’s most influential religious institutions.\nMaybe climate change and religion, which are both based on belief, have more in common than we thought.",

        "article": "Federal District Court Could Rule Against Abortion-inducing Medications\n\nAnother Likely Supreme Court Showdown\n\nAny day now, a federal District Court judge in Texas could wipe out the use of abortion-inducing medications, the result of yet another legal assault by anti-abortion forces.\nFinal arguments in a lawsuit brought by a small coalition of anti-abortion lawyers and doctors were due on Friday in a case that questions whether the Federal Drug Administration did enough testing before authorizing the use of mifepristone, one of two drugs used in a medication abortion, in the year 2000.\nIn practical terms, most abortions in the United States are by medication. The outcome of this case could force the FDA to have to withdraw use of the medication approvals even from states that now have moved to enshrine abortion rights after last year’s Supreme Court decision overthrowing Roe v. Wade.\nSince then, of course, millions have used the drugs safely.\nFrom all accounts of the lawsuit, the case is unique for attacking the medical procedures involved in testing — and in the filing of the suit in Amarillo, where U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, nominated by Donald Trump and confirmed by Republican senators, is known for his conservative views on same-sex marriage and abortion. Indeed, any appeal of an opinion would then proceed to the conservative Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\nUndoubtedly, this will end up once again before a U.S. Supreme Court lineup turned antagonistic about finding legal reasoning to retain abortion rights.\nThe abortion wars are far from over, and advocates for women, women’s health and decision making in abortion are geared up for a street fight now over the science of the medications. In a word, they find the arguments of the lawsuit baseless and reflecting of “fringe” theories.\nBut even a temporary injunction from this judge to take effect while other courts consider the arguments might require the FDA to stop sales with immediate effect nationwide.\n\nThe Drugs and the Case\nAt the heart of this case are the drugs and medical procedures and not the law or the Constitutional questions about privacy provisions underwriting perceived rights to abortion, which has been the basis of previous legal challenges.\nSince 2000, when the FDA okayed these medications, a patient first takes one pill of mifepristone, which terminates the pregnancy. Approximately 24 hours later, they typically take a four-pill dose of misoprostol, a drug first introduced in 1973 to treat stomach ulcers, to soften the cervix and prompt contractions that expel the fetus.\nMifepristone, which blocks a hormone necessary for pregnancy development, is authorized through 10 weeks of pregnancy, although many clinics and telemedicine providers have begun offering it up to 12 or 13 weeks into pregnancy. The second drug, misoprostol, has never been as tightly restricted as mifepristone and is used for many different medical conditions.\nThis suit aims to undo the approval of mifepristone. Just last month, the FDA updated its rules to allow brick-and-mortar pharmacies to dispense mifepristone — expanding access to the drug unless state law restricts it. These pills had been obtainable through the mail if health providers were certified and patients completed a consent form.\nAlliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that has been involved in anti-abortion litigation, filed the suit in November on behalf of four anti-abortion medical organizations and four doctors who say they have treated patients with the drug.\nOn its website, the Alliance outlines the case: The FDA illegally failed to protect health, safety and welfare of girls and women because it never studied the safety of the drugs under the labeled conditions of use, ignored potential impact on developing bodies of adolescents, disregarded evidence that chemical abortion drugs cause more complications than surgical abortions and eliminated.\nThe FDA “chose politics over science” by characterizing pregnancy as “an illness” and arguing that these drugs provide “a meaningful therapeutic benefit,” says the lawsuit, which is called Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “Pregnancy is not an illness, and chemical abortion drugs don’t provide a therapeutic benefit—they end a baby’s life, and they pose serious and life-threatening complications to the mother,” the website argues.\n\nThe National Implications\nThe suit has been ridiculed by legal experts as rooted in baseless and debunked arguments. But abortion rights advocates are concerned – and now have appealed to the Biden administration to take seriously – the prospects that the path of conservative courts could produce a verdict that will impose restrictions nationwide.\nApparently, some in Congress who favor abortion rights have had a hard time understanding that this could affect even states where abortion has been re-certified as legal. In the Justice Department, there is a reproductive rights task force to seek legal avenues to protect access to abortion pills. In January, that group re-issued rules saying that the U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills to people in states that have sharply restricted the procedure. Now they are looking at this Texas case, arguing that it is the FDA and not states that decide on the use of drugs.\nPresumably, if there is a strong opinion barring the use of mifepristone, or any abortion-inducing medications, the lines for surgical abortions in states where that is allowed will swell further, creating burdens for patients and health providers. Other clinics might opt to use just misoprostol pills instead of the standard regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol together.\nThe adoption by Republican-led state legislatures to enact total abortion bans has made this issue identifiably partisan and we have seen the backlash of abortion politics roil what had been expected to bigger Republican election victory in November.\nWith presidential politics for 2024 getting underway, we can be sure the abortion issue is not going away anytime soon.",

        "article": "An Open Letter To The Forced-Birth Movement–From A Former Anti-Abortion Liberal\n\nTo The “Leadership” Of The “Pro-Life” Movement:\nFor most of the time from around 2004 to 2011, I was one of you. I opposed abortion, except in cases of rape and incest. But recent events have convinced me that all your talk about protecting the sanctity of human life is nothing more than hot air. I now believe that your hand-wringing and pearl-clutching about the sanctity of life is nothing more than a backdoor attempt to erode the right to privacy. That is something with which I cannot, and will not, identify.\nYou started in 2009 when your buddies in the Oklahoma state legislature tried to set up a database containing information about every abortion performed in the state. It would have contained the mother’s age, race, marital status, and a smorgasbord of other personal information–enough that the mother could have been legally identified even though her name wasn’t included.\nAs a journalism major, I know that if you put out enough information about a person to identify them, it is no different from posting the person’s name and address. For that reason, I thought almost immediately, “There’s no way in hell this is legal–or right.” It would put women at risk for harassment or worse, especially in small counties.\nThat law was later struck down in court. But it led me to wonder–did the people who wrote this horribly misbegotten bill intend for Oklahoma women to be harassed and trolled if they got an abortion?\nThose questions grew even louder later when Cheryl Sullenger was allowed to keep her job at Operation Rescue after it emerged that she’d helped Scott Roeder keep track of George Tiller’s court dates. She knew Tiller was a marked man for anti-abortion extremists in Wichita, and yet she essentially gives his court dates to a guy off the street? At the very least, she is morally responsible for Tiller’s murder. Criminal or not, basic decency would have demanded that Sullenger be fired out of respect for Tiller’s family. To add insult to injury, Operation Rescue hired this woman even after she took part in a plan to firebomb an abortion clinic.\nI had similar questions when the Republican-controlled House tried to change the definition of rape so that only instances of “forcible rape” could qualify for taxpayer funds. The GOP knows damn well that ALL rape is forcible, since rape is non-consensual by definition. Why did you and your buddies in the House GOP caucus even think this was a good idea?\nBut one of the final straws for me came when Florida tried to require all women getting an abortion in the state to have a vaginal ultrasound. They tried this in 2010 as well. During the first attempt, several women on Daily Kos came forward to say how horribly invasive this procedure is.\nThe only plausible explanation for so many instances of invasive legislation is that at its core, your movement doesn’t have a damn thing to do with protecting life. It was intended to tug at people’s heartstrings in order to get the government in our bedrooms through the back door. On paper, as a charismatic Christian, I should be receptive to pro-life arguments. But I could not see any possible good-faith explanation for this legislative overkill–unless there was an ulterior motive. Realizing that I’d been snowed, I formally resigned from the pro-life movement in March 2011.\nI wasn’t quite ready to identify as pro-choice as of yet. But more instances of your movement’s complete and utter lack of respect for basic human dignity knocked the scales from my eyes. You sponsor crisis pregnancy centers that scare women by giving them inaccurate information–dangerously so, in many cases. You tried to push a Wisconsin law that would have given in-laws the power to stop abortions. And you continue to embrace Operation Rescue despite the fact it glossed over Sullenger’s irresponsible and potentially criminal actions, as well as her murderous past.\nBut the absolute last straw came with the ordeal of Marlise Munoz in 2014. Even though she was brain dead, she was kept on life support for almost two months because she was pregnant–a scene that can only be described as Kafkaesque. Never mind that in all states, brain death is legal death–and it is not possible to maintain life support on a dead person. Never mind that Marlise had been without oxygen for so long that it couldn’t have survived in any event.\nAnd yet, when a judge ended this farce, Operation Rescue claimed that Marlise was in a coma, and condemned what they called the murder of an incapacitated woman and her child. Watch here. [video of interview with Operation Rescue]\nTo add insult to injury, all four Republican candidates for lieutenant governor of Texas said they would have kept Marlise on life support, and two (possibly three) of them said they would amend Texas law to require brain-dead women to stay on life support if they are pregnant. According to lawyers for the Munoz family, by this logic, hospitals would be required to check dead women for signs of pregnancy and hook them up to life support if there was a fetus there. So protecting the sanctity of human life requires desecrating corpses?????!!!!\nI now realized how positively Orwellian the “pro-life” movement was. If it is even remotely possible to force corpses to stay on life support, then your movement is, at its core, about destroying the right to privacy. I also realized that a number of my Kossack friends were on to something when they suggested that it was more accurate to describe you as “forced-birthers.”\nIf you cared about the sanctity of life, why in the hell would you even consider something as ghoulish as keeping life support on dead people??????!!!! If that’s what the sanctity of life means, I’ll pass. As far as I’m concerned, you left me. I didn’t leave you.\nLately, I’ve wondered if I was ever a part of your movement in the first place. After all, you have declared that allowing women to get an abortion in case of rape and incest is merely a “political judgment” that is necessary to get abortion restrictions on the books. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! It’s basic human decency. Forcing a woman to keep the product of such a violation harkens back to the days when rape and incest was considered the victim’s fault.\nAnd now you people see nothing wrong with forcing little girls to keep their pregnancies at ages when they could be at risk for serious complications, and even death, if they go that route. Just last week, you had the gall to suggest a 12-year-old rape victim could be a murderer if she ended her pregnancy. You defend the sanctity of life when you’re not only willing to degrade a rape victim, but potentially put her at risk for taunting and bullying. Don’t you DARE say you care about her well-being when you use that kind of language. And don’t you DARE say that you care about the sanctity of life. Not when you’re willing to victimize women all over again after they have been horribly violated. You are not pro-life. You are for forced birth.\nIn the past, I’ve had people ask, “How can you be a Christian and vote for baby-killers?” Well, I, and a number of other Christians have the weird idea that abortion isn’t the be-all and end-all to everything. Moreover, I’ve seen what your movement is about at its core–and it’s fundamentally un-American. You are trying to use abortion to destroy one of the most sacrosanct rights we have that is not enumerated in the Constitution–the right to be left alone. I cannot identify with that, and I will not identify with that. Not now. Not ever.\nI’m not the only person who should be, on paper, receptive to your cause who feels this way. But I may be one of the first to lay it down in such stark terms. Either get off your sanctimonious high horses, or get out of the way.\nSincerely,\nDarrell",

According to lawyers for the Munoz family, by this logic, hospitals would be required to check dead women for signs of pregnancy and hook them up to life support if there was a fetus there. So protecting the sanctity of human life requires desecrating corpses?????!!!!\nI now realized how positively Orwellian the “pro-life” movement was. If it is even remotely possible to force corpses to stay on life support, then your movement is, at its core, about destroying the right to privacy. I also realized that a number of my Kossack friends were on to something when they suggested that it was more accurate to describe you as “forced-birthers.”",

Like all the other Republican candidates for president, he has adopted Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for fabricating facts and making outrageously offensive statements.\nHaving recently drawn a firestorm of criticism for disrespecting the families of gun violence victims, insinuating that European Jews were complicit in the Holocaust by not arming themselves sufficiently, and declaring that he would cut off funding for overly liberal universities, one would think he might consider showing a little tact with his statements. Not Carson, though, who decided a Sunday interview with Chuck Todd was a good time to announce that he wanted to overturn Roe V. Wade, deny abortions to rape victims, and compare a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body to the centuries of slavery endured by African-Americans.\n“The mother should not believe that the baby is her enemy and should not be looking to terminate the baby. We’ve allowed purveyors of division to think that baby is their enemy and they have a right to kill it. Can you see how perverted that line of thinking is?”\n“Think about this. During slavery — and I know that one of those words you’re not supposed to say — but I’m saying it. During slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave, anything that they chose to do. And what if the abolitionists had said, ‘You know, I don’t believe in slavery, I think it’s wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do.’ Where would we be?”\n“Rape or incest, I would not be for killing a baby because the baby came about in that way,” he explained. “And all you have to do is go and look up the many stories of people who have led very useful lives who are the result of rape or incest.”\nWhat’s truly perverted is Ben Carson’s thought process. The draconian system of religious morality he wants to impose on our nation and his desire to deprive American women of agency over their own bodies is the better subject for a slavery metaphor.\nThis man claims to be a doctor, but shows no concern for the health or mental well-being of American women. He claims to be a man of science, but questions where gravity comes from and denies the reality of climate change. He has no policy proposals, political experience, or coherent message other than extremist Christian fundamentalism. We absolutely cannot allow this man anywhere near the White House.",

        "article": "Wisconsin’s dangerous abortion restrictions threatened my life and will continue to harm women\n\nNearly a year and a half after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion ban went back into effect, it may be easy for some to forget the harm that the ban has been inflicting. But as anti-abortion lawmakers in our state continue to pass legislation to obstruct and stigmatize abortion, I can’t forget what these restrictions do to women like me.\nI was 19 weeks pregnant when I went into previable preterm labor with advanced cervical dilation: Our son had not developed enough to survive outside of my womb. My husband and I would inevitably lose him. We couldn’t imagine that our state’s laws would create a situation that would nearly cost me my life in the process.\nThe night before we lost our son, while my husband was away for work, I lay in bed in severe pain, searching desperately on my phone for a potential, and hopefully harmless, cause. What I read reassured me that I was just experiencing round ligament pain,meaning the ligaments surrounding my uterus were experiencing short, painful spasms. As the pain worsened, I held onto hope that I just needed to rest to alleviate it.\nIn and out of sleep all night from severe cramps, I froze at 5 a.m. when I woke to find my underwear soaked with blood. I immediately FaceTimed my mom, a nurse, who frantically said to go to the emergency room. My father took me to the hospital. I was inconsolable as he tried to convince me that everything would be okay. At that point, we were all trying to convince ourselves of that. But deep down, I had only a sliver of hope that it would be. Unfortunately, it was even worse than expected.\nI was quickly taken into triage and transferred to the obstetrics wing. Providers rushed in, first checking for a fetal heart rate. They found the heartbeat with little difficulty, and it was strong. I breathed a loud sigh of relief; while I knew there was an issue still to be resolved, I became more convinced everything would be okay. My mom told me my husband was nearby, and I was ready to tell him the good news.\nThe attending physician arrived and explained she was going to perform a pelvic exam. No one could have prepared me for what she found. My amniotic sac was bulging. What I had perceived to be round ligament pains were actually contractions, and I was six centimeters dilated. I was in labor. All I could tell myself was that this couldn’t be happening. Our baby was coming today, and at 19 weeks gestation we knew he wouldn’t survive.\nWhen my husband arrived, I was nearly hysterical. We were moved to the labor and delivery unit.\nThree doctors separately outlined how sick I would have to be before they could provide care: Under Wisconsin’s abortion ban, they couldn’t legally take action yet. Three doctors explained the risks I faced because of these egregious restrictions: I could expect an infection, sepsis or another critical illness that could result in death. Not only would I painfully lose my baby, but I could lose my life.\nSo we waited, feeling the most pain we have ever felt, as I labored hopelessly for hours. Because of the legal uncertainty surrounding our state’s abortion ban and the fear of legal consequences that accompanies it, I had to wait until I crashed to be treated instead of swiftly receiving care. The law ties doctors’ hands and forces women to be on death’s door before they can receive the care they need and deserve.\nEventually, my white blood cell count jumped, which indicated infection, and my heart rate accelerated while my blood pressure plummeted. I was prepped for an emergency dilation and evacuation, but learned once I came off of anesthesia that our baby delivered naturally. He lived for only one hour.\nWhile our son couldn’t have been saved, the way we lost him was made worse by Wisconsin’s extreme and dangerous abortion ban. I couldn’t just grieve for this loss, which was excruciating enough — I also had to needlessly worry about living. This additional fear could have been prevented had my doctors been allowed to provide safe and simple abortion care.\nEven though a Dane County judge has issued a preliminary finding that the 1849 law does not ban elective abortion, leading Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin to resume offering abortion care in Milwaukee and Madison, women are no safer. Doctors attending pregnant women in critical medical distress are being forced to hesitate to act.\n“Wisconsin leaders are tying doctors’ hands by preventing them from providing swift abortion care to patients in medical distress,” said Dr. Kristin Lyerly, a Green Bay OB/GYN and member of the Committee to Protect Health Care. “Doctors should be able to rely on their medical expertise to treat patients, not be forced to follow dangerous policies passed by legislators who prioritize their political agenda over the health and well-being of their constituents”\nWhile Wisconsin leaders continue working to restrict and stigmatize abortion, we want our story to serve as a reminder that these laws have life-threatening, heartbreaking implications for women and families across our state.\nMy husband and I firmly believe that lawmakers have no place in the exam room, and that women need to be able to make their own health care decisions with their doctors, particularly in medical emergencies. Abortion is not black and white; each circumstance that leads a woman to seek care is unique. That’s why one-size-fits all bans and laws don’t work. My family and I do not want another family to have to experience the trauma we have endured.",

        "article": "The Beginning of a Frightening New Era in North Carolina\n\nI’ve always been intentional about distinguishing myself as “from New Orleans” rather than “from Louisiana.” I am ashamed to be from Louisiana, a state that has passed one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation. A ban that doesn’t even allow exceptions for rape and incest.\nNow I can’t help but wonder, is this the trajectory North Carolina is on? It terrifies me to think SB20, which goes into effect on July 1st, is only the beginning, as many of our Republican legislators have touted victoriously. We’ve seen the bans pass in other states, and the consequences have been dire. The manner in which SB20 was passed was absolutely shameful and undemocratic. If Republicans are willing to resort to these deceitful and Machiavellian tactics, what is next for North Carolina?\nAt 33 years of age, I’m well into the stage of life in which friends are starting or expanding their families. Thanks to bills like SB20, however, when a friend shares news of a pregnancy, my heart sinks, even if this is happy news for my friends. Terror is the first feeling I experience now. Not joy. Not surprise. Sheer terror. It’s frightening for me, and I’m only the recipient of the news. It’s even more anxiety provoking for my pregnant friends who are afraid that something will go wrong, and they won’t receive the reproductive healthcare they need and deserve.\nFor many, pregnancy is a joyous and exciting time. No one wants to think that something may go wrong with their pregnancy. Before SB20, pregnant patients at least had the security and peace of mind in knowing that medical professionals were available to provide them with treatment options.\nNow, however, their joy and excitement might be tempered with fear and anxiety that if a medical complication arises, they might not get the care they need. In the year since the Dobbs decision came down, we have heard so many stories, often directly from patients themselves on social media, sharing their experiences of being denied care until it was nearly too late. We’ve heard the stories of patients being forced to carry non-viable pregnancies. Anyone who has watched the news in the past year has likely heard these stories coming out of Texas, Missouri, Nebraska, my home state, Louisiana, and all of the other states with total or severe abortion bans.\nNorth Carolina had the opportunity to continue to be a safe haven for patients and providers across the entire south who were being denied care due to politics. Had we expanded reproductive healthcare access in North Carolina, we could’ve created more practices that offer reproductive healthcare, attracted the best healthcare providers, and served patients across the south who needed abortion and comprehensive reproductive healthcare services.\nBut our Republican-controlled legislature closed the door to these opportunities: to codifying Roe v. Wade, to attracting the best doctors in the nation, to addressing our abysmal maternal mortality rates, and to expanding our healthcare system, especially in rural areas. Our legislature has endangered patients, particularly those who already struggle to access any kind of healthcare and providers.\nEthically treating patients, according to best medical practices, means that providers will potentially have to decide if they want to risk the license and livelihood they worked so hard to achieve to stay in North Carolina. SB20 is cruel and will hurt patients and providers.\nWhen Roe was overturned a year ago, I told my friends and family in New Orleans, and along the Gulf Coast, that they were always welcome in North Carolina. But when the Republicans voted to override Governor Cooper’s veto on SB20, they made it clear that those who care about pregnant patients and those who believe in our rights to control our own bodies and lives don’t count in North Carolina. Women and people who can get pregnant are de facto second-class citizens here.\nThis is not a state that I’m proud to call home either.",

        "article": "Restrictive abortion laws threaten our national security\n\nWhen we raised our right hands and put on the uniform, a shared love of country brought people from all backgrounds together. In Iraq and Afghanistan, we fought alongside service members from every race, gender, and political affiliation — and we had each other’s backs. We still do.\nOur armed forces are the standard bearer for American values and principles around the world, and those who serve reflect the nation’s rich diversity of thought, background, and experiences. This diversity makes our military the world’s strongest and most lethal fighting force.\nHowever, some politicians have not only begun to disparage our service members and undermine our top military leaders, but they’ve also set their crosshairs on some of the same service members we fought beside and to whom we all owe a tremendous debt.\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling last year in Dobbs v. Jackson, overturning Roe v. Wade, thousands of women in service were stripped of access to abortion care. In the year since, 14 states have made abortion illegal, according to the Center for Reproductive rights.\nLet’s talk about how these restrictive laws threaten our national security.\nWhen people decide to serve, they take the same oath we took — the same oath millions of others have taken over our nation’s history. You raise your right hand, go to boot camp, get trained on your job, and go where the nation needs you. You don’t have a choice about where you go to serve — that’s part of the deal.\nMore than 230,000 women and 14,000 LGBTQ+ people serve in our armed forces today, meaning thousands of active duty service members stationed in states with restrictive laws are feeling the brunt of extreme politicians’ efforts to limit their freedoms. The last thing we want to see is accomplished service members separating from service early after being assigned to a duty station where they and their dependents cannot access the healthcare they need.\nIn the aftermath of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, then-Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Gil Cisneros testified to Congress that, “some servicemembers may choose to leave the military altogether because they may be stationed in states with restrictive reproductive health laws.”\nRetention isn’t the only place our armed forces will suffer because of these extreme laws restricting service members’ freedoms — recruitment will suffer too. Roughly three-quarters of young people believe abortion should be legal. How can we expect recruitment numbers to increase if prospective service members fear being stationed in an area where they’ll be treated like second-class citizens?\nPersonnel is the most important aspect of readiness. As recruitment and retention continue to fall, so does the military’s ability to meet the force requirements necessary to respond to any threat. Service members should be able to focus solely on their mission, not be forced to worry about whether they or their loved ones at home can access the health care they need.\nThankfully, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, and the Department of Defense acted in the best interest of our national security by protecting access to health care — including reproductive care — for service members and their families, regardless of where they’re stationed. This decision wasn’t driven by politics or the loudest voice but by a conscious and strategic effort to ensure our military maintains its standing as the world’s strongest and most lethal fighting force.\nNow, Sen. Tommy Tuberville has responded by blocking DoD nominations for his own political gain. Not to mention, a small faction in the House of Representatives pushed through a defense authorization bill that would reverse the policy, putting military pay raises on the line and using our service members as pawns to advance their own agenda.\nSo let’s be clear, Sen. Tuberville is actively holding our military hostage and undermining service members who have sacrificed their lives to protect him and his constituents.\nHe must stand down.\nWe learned during our service that our values and national security go hand-in-hand. Our military leaders should always do what’s best for our men and women who serve. We have no doubt that they will continue insulating service members from restrictive state laws just like they do with service members stationed overseas in countries with laws inconsistent with our values.\nSoldiers, airmen, guardians, sailors, and Marines put on the uniform because this country is worth fighting for. Safeguarding our freedoms, keeping our loved ones safe, and providing a future for our children and grandchildren transcends politics and the vitriol that dominates our nation’s discourse.\nThat’s why we chose to serve. That’s why countless women in service chose to serve. We can’t afford to lose them. Our national security depends on it.\nBut more than that, the health, well-being, and freedoms of our service members and their families depend on it.",

        "article": "How To Perform An Abortion According To The Bible\n\nI don’t turn to the Bible in order to determine what is right, moral, good, just, or ethical. But a lot of Christians do. They talk about a biblical worldview this, a Bible-based decision that. Typically, in America, Biblical means right-wing; you stand for “traditional” marriages and against abortions.\nBut what if I told you that the Bible not only condones abortion, it gives a recipe for how to perform one? Would you be surprised?\nWell, some of you wouldn’t. I’m sure you’re aware of the story from Numbers 5. For those who aren’t, here’s verses 19 through 22: Then the priest shall make her take an oath, saying, “If no man has lain with you, if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while under your husband’s authority, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings the curse. But if you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority, if you have defiled yourself and some man other than your husband has had intercourse with you,” —let the priest make the woman take the oath of the curse and say to the woman—“the Lord make you an execration and an oath among your people, when the Lord makes your uterus drop, your womb discharge; now may this water that brings the curse enter your bowels and make your womb discharge, your uterus drop!” And the woman shall say, “Amen. Amen.”\nThat’s a lengthy way to say that if a woman cheats on her husband and gets pregnant, the priest is to perform an abortion by having her drink “bitter water.”\nAmen. Amen.\nBut again, because I don’t turn to the Bible to determine what is right and good, I’m not suggesting this is the best way to go about performing abortions. It’s a highly patriarchal and sexist practice, if taken at face value. The point, then, is simply this: If you have a literalist approach to the Bible, you can’t avoid this passage. You have to take it head on. If you’re anti-abortion and pro-“Word of God,” then you can’t skirt this issue forever.\nNow, obviously that’s exactly what most Christians will do; they will avoid this passage at all costs. You won’t hear many sermons on Numbers 5, not many sermons entitled “Here’s How The Word of God Says We Should Abort Fetuses.” But that’s the thing about so many Christians in America; they have a pick-and-choose approach to the Bible. To put it this way: They cherry-pick the Bible when it’s suitable for them.\nOf course, cherry-picking is fine. I admit that much in many places. The question, then, is this: HOW are we going to cherry-pick? Are we going to pick the cherries that point us toward love, inclusion, acceptance, mercy, tolerance, patience, kindness, and social justice? Or, are we going to do what the fundamentalists do and pick the rotten cherries of violence, bigotry, homophobia, exclusion, wrath, and vengeance?\nThat’s what is so fascinating about the Bible. You can make it say basically whatever you want it to say. And that’s exactly why it’s not my rulebook for life, and never will be. It’s too dangerous, and has caused too much harm over the millennia.\nMaybe you see things differently, and if you do, put something in the comments. Just be kind, or I’ll make you drink some bitter water.\nAmen. Amen.",

        "article": "How abortion hypocrisy kills women\n\nOpposition to abortion is so intense that even where women have the legal right to terminate their pregnancy, it can be extremely difficult to access the services needed to exercise that right. But, worse than that, opponents of abortion tend to ignore the failures that lead women to the point where they seek one in the first place.\nFrom a moral standpoint, there is a strong case to be made for respecting a woman’s personal freedom and bodily autonomy, rather than forcing her to put her health or well-being at risk by carrying an unwanted or unsafe pregnancy to term. Yet, given how rife with misinformation and muddied by misplaced arguments the issue is, policy debates often go nowhere unless they frame abortion first and foremost as a health matter.\nConsider the case of Kenya. Despite having one of Africa’s most progressive abortion laws, a woman has the right to terminate a pregnancy if “there is need for emergency treatment, or the life or health of the mother is in danger, or if permitted by any other written law”, enduring opposition to abortion has undermined implementation. And this is to say nothing of the women who would not qualify for an abortion under these rules.\nBut it is well documented that outlawing abortion does not end the practice. Rather, when the authorities jail anyone who is rumored to be providing safe abortions, as occurs in Kenya, women end up turning to providers who use highly dangerous methods to get the job done. For example, they perforate women’s uteruses with sharp objects, sit on women’s bellies to eject the fetus and prescribe unsafe concoctions.\nTo avoid these back-alley providers, women try to induce abortions by ingesting large amounts of painkillers or poisoning themselves with detergents. Some die; others are left with no uterus; still others are left managing complications like cervicovaginal fistulas.\nAfter years working in reproductive health, I can say authoritatively that women do not terminate pregnancies on a whim. They do not pay an unqualified person to stab their uterus because the mood strikes them. Condemning them will not change their minds; nor will prioritising the development of a fetus over the needs, rights and well-being of its mother. All it will do is make them more likely to risk their health and lives seeking an unsafe abortion.\nIf we want to reduce demand for abortion services, we must recognise that it is often the culmination of a series of systemic failures that begin during childhood, when a comprehensive sexual education (CSE) should be required. A CSE teaches young people about sex and relationships in an age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, realistic, non-judgmental and scientifically accurate way, and can increase the use of contraceptives and reduce teen pregnancy rates, particularly if it takes a gender-based approach, focusing on empowering young girls to protect their own health.\nSuch an education is not a privilege, but a right. In Kenya, Article 35 of the constitution guarantees every citizen “the right of access to information held by another person and required for the exercise or protection of any right or fundamental freedom”. This includes the right to reproductive healthcare, enshrined in Article 43.\nBut, like the right to abortion, the right to CSE is often not respected, owing to moralising resistance from religious leaders and anti-choice movements, as well as other factors, such as weak dissemination of the curriculum and a dearth of adequately trained teachers. As a result, myths and misconceptions remain widespread.\nThis, together with funding shortages and cultural factors, such as a lack of male involvement in reproductive-health issues, contribute to low contraceptive uptake, with only 58 per cent of women in Kenya who should be using modern contraceptives actually doing so. Unsurprisingly, teenage pregnancy is unacceptably high.\nIt is time to address the systemic failures that lead to girls and women ending up maimed or dead. Here, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: contraception in health budgets, quality CSE in schools, and youth-friendly reproductive-health services.\nBut the cure must also be an option. Rules that punish women must be replaced with modern laws, in line with international human-rights frameworks, that protect women’s reproductive freedom, including by guaranteeing access to safe abortion services. Written guidelines to end the victimisation of abortion service providers are also needed.\nHow can a government that fails to ensure CSE or invest adequately in family planning penalise its women for unwanted pregnancies? How can a society that ignores women’s suffering blame the victims for its inaction? Those who do nothing to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and everything to punish the women affected by them, cannot claim the moral high ground.",

Jeff Merkley of Oregon told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that one particular family “relayed to me how they three times have gotten a text message [or] email saying, ‘Drop everything [and] go to the Rafah crossing,’ and they waited until dark. But each time, nothing happened.”\n“They weren’t interfered with by Hamas, just the gate never opened. With the trucks coming in [with humanitarian aid from Egypt], why can’t we at the same time … get those American families … out that gate?” he pressed.\nBlinen said there have been “occasions where we thought that we would be able to move forward … only to find that the necessary procedures that had to be put in place to actually make that work couldn’t go forward,” adding that “Hamas has been the impediment to that.” \n“We’re working on it with Egypt. We’re working on it with Israel. We’re looking for ways to get people out. But because Hamas controls what goes on for the most part inside of Gaza, unless it agrees, then it’s going to be very difficult to get that done,” he added.\n“It is true the Egyptians are prepared to allow American citizens and foreign nationals to come through the Rafah gate into Egypt. The Israelis have no issue with that,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan stated.\n“Hamas has been preventing their departure and making a series of demands. I can’t go through those demands in public, but that is the subject of the discussions in the negotiations that are ongoing,” he added.\n",

        "article": "Trump Calls DeSantis Abortion Ban ‘A Terrible Mistake,’ Sparking Anger From Some Key Republicans\n\nDonald Trump is facing new blowback from anti-abortion activists for refusing to commit to national abortion restrictions and for calling Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signing of a six-week ban on the procedure a “terrible mistake.”\nSpeaking Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump repeatedly declined to say whether he would support a federal ban on abortion. He said he could “live with” the procedure being banned by individual states or nationwide through federal action, though he said “from a legal standpoint, I think it’s probably better” to be handled at the state level.\nRegarding the bill signed by DeSantis, which bans abortions before many women know they are pregnant, Trump said, “I think what he did is a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.”\nSo far, the former president has dominated the 2024 field while at times spurning the anti-abortion groups that traditionally have huge influence in Republican primaries. But Trump’s direct attack on DeSantis, whom he’s long treated as his chief rival, could give the Florida governor new fodder as he tries to regain momentum in his campaign and solidify his second-place standing.\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin wrote of Trump: “If you want to appease Democrats, here’s your guy. If you want to defeat the Democrats in 2024, (DeSantis) is the only choice.”\nThe country’s largest anti-abortion organization, which backs a national ban on abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy, quickly released a statement saying anything less restrictive “makes no sense.”\n“We’re at a moment where we need a human rights advocate, someone who is dedicated to saving the lives of children and serving mothers in need. Every single candidate should be clear on how they plan to do that,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\nEvangelicals and other social conservatives who strongly oppose abortion make up the majority of those who participate and decide the winner in Iowa, where the Jan. 15 caucuses are first on the Republican nominating calendar. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds this summer signed an abortion ban similar to Florida’s. Reynolds has not endorsed a candidate.\nTrump has called himself the “the most pro-life president in American history” and noted that three of his picks for the Supreme Court formed the conservative majority that overturned Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal right to abortion.\nInterviews with GOP voters and activists over the past several months suggest a split between people who point to Trump’s record during his term and others who want Trump to endorse a national abortion ban.\nTrump has so far declined to go along with some of his rivals, including his onetime vice president, Mike Pence, who is pushing for national bans that would take effect relatively early in a pregnancy. He’s warned Republicans against locking themselves into positions that are unpopular with a majority of the public and has argued that the Supreme Court’s decision gives abortion opponents the right to “negotiate” restrictions where they live rather than rely on federal bans.\nThe Supreme Court ruling left the decision of whether and how to restrict abortion to the states, creating a patchwork of laws across the country, with most Republican-led states imposing new restrictions and states led by Democrats passing protections. Twenty-five million women of childbearing age now live in states where abortions are more difficult to get since before the ruling.\nTrump also has approached the issue from a political stance, saying that the court’s ruling and Republicans’ push for abortion restrictions hurt the GOP in the 2022 midterm elections and that GOP candidates need to do a better job of explaining the issue.\nRepublicans in some key states, including those backing his rivals, expressed displeasure.\nAmong them was South Carolina state Rep. John McCravy, who sponsored the most recent, restrictive abortion measure, which bans the practice in his state after around six weeks of pregnancy. South Carolina will be among the early states to choose a nominee.\n“I was certainly disappointed with what I heard from President Trump today concerning the Florida Heartbeat Bill,” McCravy told The Associated Press, after watching Trump’s interview. “It sounded completely out of step with his staunch support for life while he was president.”\nMcCravy has endorsed South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott in the 2024 GOP presidential primary but told AP last week, “Trump would probably be a close second, noting his Supreme Court appointments and his attending the March for Life rally in Washington.\n“Hopefully he will re-think and clarify his position concerning life and the Heartbeat Bill after the political fallout which is sure to come,” McCravy said.\nOne of the anti-abortion leaders in the battleground state of Arizona posted a segment of the “Meet the Press” interview on X. Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, wrote that Trump “has abandoned the pro-life movement.”\n“Watch this in its entirety,” Herrod wrote. “He criticizes Ron DeSantis for signing heartbeat bill. Won’t commit to a position. Unacceptable. Time to move on.”\nKristen Waggoner, CEO of the conservative legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, also took issue. “Laws protecting the unborn are not a ‘terrible mistake.’ They are the hallmark of a just and moral society,” she wrote on X. “Governors who protect life should be applauded, not attacked.”",

No good thing is usually easy. Doing a hard thing will be hitting this head on. We must work to protect life and we must work on how we message this.”\nThe senator thinks her party needs to highlight the radical position of Democrats on abortion.\n“We know that the Democrats have an extreme policy and yet we’ve allowed them to control the airwaves and deflect from that,” she argued. “It was last year when every single Democrat voted to be able to take the life of a child the moment before a child was born. And that’s not something that we should allow them to run from. I believe that is not where people in this nation are.”\nBritt said many of states’ current abortion policies are among the worse in the world.\n“Having abortions after 24 weeks puts the U.S…in a category with only four other nations with regards to that, and one of them is China and one of them is North Korea,” she explained. “And so I certainly don’t want to be in a category with them on this or much of anything.”\nShe emphasized the need for her party to “do better” when it comes to reaching voters on some of the most important issues the country faces.\n“I think we’ve got to just do better,” she said. “We’ve got to be honest about it and figure out how we do a better job of talking on talking to voters. I think we’re right on policy issues. When you look at this nation, whether it is the border, whether it’s abroad, whether it’s here at home, we are weaker on more vulnerable every day that Joe Biden is in the White House. We need to make sure that parents and hard working people know that we’re fighting for them and we also have to fight for the moral compass of this country. I believe that is worth fighting for, I believe that is what we’re called to do, and I think that’s what’s ahead of us.”",

        "article": "Progressive/Leftists Target Black Women for Abortions\n\nThe U.S. SCOTUS ruling correcting federal law by returning the issue of abortion back to the states has prompted Black women to become a focal point as leverage for leftist/progressive actions and agitations.\nIf Black women confirmed the KKK wanted them to abort their babies, they'd double down on having as many babies as possible in revolt. If Black women confirmed evil racists wanted to exterminate their race via targeting them for abortion, they would reject and denounce abortions. If Black women confirmed abortion was specifically concocted to enshrine and uphold \"White Supremacy,\" they would reject it altogether. It's time to tell Black women historical facts and truth instead of purposeful attempts to use and manipulate them for evil.\nGenerally speaking, Black women are strong, determined, and loyal to causes they deem worthy. While these attributes can also characterize many other demographics, Black women are viewed and targeted as a significant monolith segment within the leftist/progressive universe. And since they make up a substantial percentage of their audience, contrived manipulation and deceptions are continuously targeted toward this group. The most grotesque deceptions used to manipulate this group are purposeful omissions.\nThere is a reason why Progressives omit the fact that the Founder of Planned Parenthood (Margret Sanger) was a frequent speaker and contributor to the women's Ku Klux Klan (KKK), and started her clinics to \"exterminate the negro population\" (her exact words). If Black girls had been learning this as a great example of \"systemic racism\" in school over the decades (since Roe), Black women would utterly reject abortion today. From the Leftist/Progressive point of view, this omission is necessary for the continued use and manipulation of Black women on abortion. The omission is weaponized against black women.\nThere is a reason why progressives omit the disproportionate targeting of Black communities for abortions. Suppose Black women realized that up to 90% of the strategic placement of \"abortuaries\" (\"abortion clinics\") are within walking distance of Black communities. In comparison, Blacks only make up 13% of the population and child-bearing aged Black women only approx. 3.5%. Strategic targeting of Black preborn babies' lives (via abortion) translates to the fact that (even with significant demographic and population differences) up to 40+% of all abortions are Black babies! If Black women were apprised of these facts, they would see this as what it is… hateful racist targeting of the Black community! They would almost universally reject abortions. From the Leftist/Progressive point of view, omitting facts about targeting Black communities with abortion is necessary for the continued manipulation of Black women. The tactic of omission is a tool for brainwashing.\nThere is a reason why progressives omit the fact that abortion is borne out of eugenics. Eugenics means \"well-born,\" and its founders, Charles Darwin and his first cousin Francis Galton, were racists determined to protect the supremacy of the White/Aryan race (whom they deemed \"well-born\"). They concocted eugenics as a scheme to provide \"scientific justification\" for the extermination of other ethnicities; they didn't want any other races to taint their \"pure\" Caucasian gene pool. These facts are notable and inconvenient. Black women would detest this motive and scheme of \"White supremacy\" if they knew and would reject abortions, so Leftist/Progressives omit!\nAll told, leftist/progressives' ultimate desire is to omit facts about abortion to continue perpetuating manipulation and disempowerment of Black women. Since Black women are an influential segment of their political and activist base, there's a need to keep them trapped in false narratives and focused on race agitation against White Supremacy.\nEvery Black Life Matters (EBLM) stands against all racism and White Supremacy wherever it exists. That said, we call out the reprobation of teachers for purposely omitting confirmed racist/White Supremacist machinations of Darwin. We call out leftist/progressives for purposely omitting the truth about the racism of abortion and its pioneer Margret Sanger. We call out all politicians who, knowing its eugenicist roots, still firmly support and embrace abortion. All these factions are definitively against Black life and the well-being of Black women! \"We see you,\" and we denounce and reject you!\nEBLM embraces the dignity of life and, by providing historical facts and truth, demands dignity and respect for every woman (especially Black women, since they're specifically targeted for manipulation). Will you stand with us as we confront abusive manipulators and help ensure Black women are no longer used as mere \"Progressive tools\" to help leftist/progressive causes? The facts confirm that all those who knowingly support abortion and its racist history are themselves, racists! From the highest authority (the White House) to political parties and individual politicians, educators, media/entertainment personalities, to community organizations, all who support the racism of abortion must be held to account.\nIt's a binary choice! Renounce and denounce the racism and White Supremacy of abortion, or embrace it with full racist vigor. Either way, stop continued deceptions directed at Black women to perpetuate support of racist causes that undermine and are antithetical to the morals and values of our community. EBLM demands there be no more leveraging of Black women for evil…\" We see you!\"",

In other words, God's Big Truth is losing badly – our fault for not uniting sooner. Essential to winning is this fundamental clarification:\nIt's the \"abortion-homicide\" issue!\nHomicide is defined as: one human killing another.\nWe'll never create and implement an effective plan to end The Great American Abortion Holocaust if we can't admit that we're badly losing the PR battle (13% to 85%) to folks who – knowing both parents are human – sincerely ask, \"When is 'it' human?\" Nazis didn't even call their victims \"it.\"\n\nTruthify or babies die\nThe following corrected excerpt from Planned Parenthood's website illustrates how this simple tactic will cause PP and the Democratic Party to lose all credibility when we refuse to use their pro-abortion euphemism. Instead, \"swing\" back: \"Abortion-homicide.\"\nThis excerpt from a PP webpage (with \"-homicide\" added) shows how that child-sacrificing cult uses \"abortion\" to hide the fact that every abortion is a homicide: \"The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which means that states can now ban abortion-homicide. Some states have banned abortion-homicide or created lots of restrictions. But abortion-homicide is still legal in many states, and it's legal to go to a different state to get an abortion-homicide. Abortion-homicide is NOT banned nationwide.\"\nImagine how support and the number of abortion-homicides would drop if everyone were required to use the truthful term, \"abortion-homicide.\"\nWe must unite and expose to the entire nation (not just our mailing lists) the Roe/Dobbs Big Lie, a legal fiction that demonically proclaims \"abortion-homicide is not homicide\" because a preborn baby is not legally alive according to \"the law of the land\" (yes, Dobbs) but \"… at most, represents only the potentiality of life.\" (Roe, page 162.)\nDefinition of \"potential\": possible, as opposed to actual, or \"not actually alive.\"\nAppallingly, 85% of Americans believe that demonic Big Lie – including the Dobbs justices who, when in effect reauthorizing Roe's genocide, used its executioner’s legal fiction uncritically 12 times!\nNote: \"Legal fiction\" is how corporations acquire legal \"personhood.\"\nExplaining Dobbs' genocidal culpability for upholding Roe's demonic legal fiction are two columns: \"STOP saying 'Roe was overturned'!\" (indicting the conservative justices), and \"How to end abortion-homicide AND defeat Democrats in 2024.\"\nThe Roe/Dobbs legal fiction (\"potential life\") is how courts deceptively evade using the word \"homicide\" when ruling on abortion-homicide.\nProtected by the demonic Roe/Dobbs legal fiction: 1-An abortion-homicide doctor can treat \"a woman\" instead of a mother \"with child.\" 2- Doctors commit hundreds of thousands of abortion-homicides yearly with no legal consequences, receive high pay (murder-for-hire), and are socially accepted by 85% of Americans – while a guy who kills his pregnant girlfriend gets charged with two murders.\nQuestion: What do Hitler's Nazis, Southern slave masters and today's abortion-homicides advocates/practitioners have in common?\nAnswer: Each group's crimes against humanity were/are socially acceptable because they were/are \"the law of the land\" (Dobbs).\n\nNegotiating with evil is appeasement\nDebating policy with the advocates of mass abortion-homicide implicitly, but clearly, accepts their premise (\"it\" isn't alive/human). Therefore, policy debates are just a matter of how we compromise with evil (15-22 weeks vs. 6 weeks, etc.).\nWatch this 5-minute clip from the DeSantis/Newsom debate (about abortion-homicide), especially the last 0:45, to see how DeSantis' policy debate implicitly, but clearly, accepted Newsom's premise: \"that 'it' isn't alive/human.\" Otherwise, why would DeSantis – or any pro-life politician – agree to any abortion-homicides – at any time – if he truly believes that abortion is homicide? As you listen, add \"-homicide\" to each \"abortion\" reference to understand how Newsom would lose all credibility – even to himself.\nWhat if 85% of the country favored slavery, killing Jews, or all of the lawyers? Are slavery and killing humans legitimate subjects for the ballot? Oh, it's OK when the victims are defined in law as \"inferior\" (Dred Scott), \"subhuman\" (Nazis), or \"potential life\" (merely an \"it\" according to Roe/Dobbs).\nEngaging in policy debates with genociders like Newsom 1) grants them credibility, 2) make us appear weak, and 3) emboldens them with self-righteousness – just watch Newsom.\nEvil was similarly appeased before the Civil War when the political compromise was to wrap the issue of slavery in a democratic veneer and let the states decide whether to legalize evil. Dobbs did the same!\nWithout their Big Lie euphemisms and our policy appeasements, political support for abortion-homicide will evaporate, and the reality-denying 85% (voters) will have to acknowledge the homicidal (personal) and genocidal (national) nature of their child-sacrificing obsession.\n\nThe Plan: 1- Unite! 2- Stop appeasing evil. 3- Take off \"the gloves,\" and swing God's Big Truth War Club to inflict some good ol' shame and guilt on the shameful and guilty – or we'll never expose the Big Lie to the deceived and/or undecided – the 85% we need to win elections\nThe good news is that we only need about half of them. Without them, however, it's subjugation or civil war.\nThis PR plan will devastate the party married to abortion-homicide just like that same party's commitment to slavery led to its 19th-century downfall when courageous Republicans stopped compromising and acted on their convictions.\nWe urgently need to test-market and roll out a national PR campaign to the 85% of Americans who need to be whacked upside their heads with God's Big Truth War Club about the living reality of our preborn brothers and sisters – before November.\n\nJoin the Pro-life War Club: email [email protected].\nShare this on social media; call/email every radio and TV show.

        "article": "Logging Off for Life\n\nIn order to fight abortion, pro-lifers must fight the screen.\n\nDespite the great triumph of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization nearly two years ago, the pro-life movement has been losing ground. According to recent data, in states that haven’t banned abortion, the number of abortions has skyrocketed, more than offsetting the reduced number of abortions in states restricting it. While researchers “estimated that around 465,000 abortions occurred during the first six months of 2020, they estimated that about 511,000 occurred during the same period in 2023.” This doesn’t even include mothers who used the abortion pill, which accounts for more than half of all abortions.\nAll this should be a wakeup call for those of us who believed that Dobbs was the culmination of many decades of pro-life activism, a decision that would usher in a pro-life era. The hope was that the movement would be galvanized and a majority of states would follow suit and choose life.\nInstead, the opposite happened. And to make matters worse, militant pro-abortion extremists have been free to deface, vandalize, and occasionally firebomb pregnancy centers. In the courts, the federal government is giving jail time to pro-lifers who dare to exercise their right to speak out at abortion clinics. Doubtless, whatever momentum there was for saving the unborn was quickly smothered by these forces.\nThat said, although this lawless intimidation campaign explains why the pro-life movement has stalled out, it doesn’t explain why more women than before are persuaded to abort their children. It’s not like the arguments have changed. Abortion is still murder. The oft-mentioned but extremely rare exceptions—rape, incest, preserving maternal life—never logically justified all abortions. The stale narratives of female empowerment didn’t somehow become compelling and fresh. And the idea of “bodily autonomy” or “my body, my choice” was officially nullified in the effort to push vaccine mandates.\nSo, if these arguments didn’t change people’s mind on abortion, what did?\nSomething in our culture changed—specifically, people’s perception of killing an innocent child in the womb. At some point in the past few years, many have decided that an unborn child is not a person and an abortion only amounts to cancelling something undesirable. Moreover, the same moral objections that formerly held some back from taking this action register with fewer people today.\nThere’s one major factor that can account for such a change: increased time online. Even if internet use was high in prior years, this became much worse after Covid, as people began to use the internet for everything—work, school, shopping, and basic interactions with family and friends. Ever since the Covid lockdowns, the majority of Americans have become utterly dependent on their screens, and quite predictably, their attitudes about key issues have been affected.\nOverall, the extra time online has made users shallow and desensitized. As Nicholas Carr argued in both his book The Shallows and the classic essay “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” people who use the internet at all hours of the day will find their mind becoming flattened and scattered: “what the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to take in information the way the Net distributes it: in a swiftly moving stream of particles.” This means that if an argument takes too long or requires any degree of personal reflection, it will have a harder time resonating with people conditioned to learn about the world through memes and short videos.\nWhen it comes to big issues like abortion, the widespread habit of being always online has made people irrational and callous. Nothing about extinguishing a human life is real to them, and the whole thing seems relative. The grave evils of the abortion regime are as impersonal and unchangeable as the recent earthquake in Morocco or the wildfires in Hawaii. Sure, it might be sad, but it’s a distant issue with little bearing on one’s life—even for those considering aborting their own children. And in the unlikely event that a person has moral qualms, these are easily put to rest with ubiquitous pro-abortion online media content that normalizes all of it.\nAdditionally, the excessive time online has made adults (at least adults of child-bearing age) much less mature, which has direct bearing on their decision to abort. In the past, the usual hypothetical scenario presented by pro-abortion advocates was the bright teenager who made a mistake and now finds her whole future jeopardized by the prospect of early motherhood. Now, a more accurate scenario is a college graduate in her twenties who is nonetheless new at “adulting” and feels generally unprepared to have a child. This feeling can likely be attributed to the fact that she’s spending her days distracting herself on the internet.\nIn light of this, the pro-life movement will need to change course. It’s not so much about changing hearts and minds as it is about changing habits. Massive marches in the cities, picketing at abortion clinics, and sophisticated pro-life arguments simply don’t reach people anymore—most aren’t even there to see or hear any of it. Rather, pro-lifers today must make a case for adults living offline before they can make a case for babies living in the womb. To this end, they should host events and create institutions that encourage people to disconnect from their devices so that they can reconnect with their own humanity and recover the capacity for cherishing life.\nAs philosopher Michael Robillard recently argued in The American Mind, “Only by re-inhabiting traditional self-reliant practices, embodied physical skills, and ways of being in the world, both individually and collectively, can prospective leaders recover a sense of the immediate stakes as well as real-world physical consequences connected to our words and our actions.” In order to recognize the stakes of abortion and other great moral matters, our lives need to be reordered around the physical realm. People aren’t made to spend their waking life staring at flitting shadows in the endless virtual caverns of the internet. Over time, it scrambles their moral compass and erodes their thinking.\nNaturally, religious communities are already outfitted for this project and should take the lead, but that doesn’t prevent other non-religious organizations to unite with them. After all, the same sentiments that inspire people to protect the unborn also move them to support the arts, conserve wildlife, and help the less fortunate. All this and more is possible, and could even trigger another Great Awakening that would revive a civilization in decline. We just need to log off for a while and tell others to do same.",

And presented an incomplete justification for its action.”\nThose utterances will be condemned as taking reproductive rights away from women. Leftists will tell you that whoever spoke those words should be run out of town after being tarred and feathered. It is interesting to see the reaction from the progressive socialists and rabid feminists when they are told those words were uttered by none other than Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1985. Even MSNBC knew that Roe v Wade stands on a weak foundation. Destroying the states rights to compromise the outcome of the citizens on abortion, what Roe v Wade has done is force a no-compromise ruling on the states and silenced any opposition until lately.\nIt is based on a woman’s right to privacy not found in the Constitution but was the premise to override a states legislative choice. The choice of the individual states is based on the wishes of the citizens of that state. The Supreme Court used arguments not enumerated in the Constitution to allow progressive socialist to inflict on the people of this country a “constitutional right” that does not exist and never has. It isn’t even legally flimsy but has no basis in the founding documents without the beleaguered opinion of the Supreme Court. For abortion to be codified, it may be by the passage of an Amendment and not by the views of the Justices who have convictions about the morality of abortion.\nIt is ridiculous that abortion is framed in the mantle of “reproductive justice.” The question that needs to be asked is justice for whom? Ignoring the civil and human right of an unborn child is not the foundation of our country and the religious tenets that founded our nations. Neither is the indoctrination of our children by elected officials on the virtue of abortion.\nOr take the case of Dr. Warren Hern an abortionist that MSNBC had on to declare that those against abortion are terrorists going so far as comparing them to the Taliban. Both he and the correspondent went further to accuse anti-abortionists as creating violence and intimidation and of being mindless fanatics.\nThey ignore people like Kermit Gosnell, a fanatic in his own right, and in states like Pennsylvania, refuse even to consider primary medical care to be available at the site of an abortion. The Pennsylvania law would allow for no bans, eradicating a “heartbeat bill” that has passed in Pennsylvania and allowing partial birth abortions. Infanticide will be the law of the land if the progressive socialists have their way.\nProgressive socialist politicians also feel the need to get involved. Pete Buttigieg even went so far as to inform Christians that abortion law was based on the Christian teaching of helping “the least among us.” Christians understand what the mention of those words in the Bible really means, and it does not include the tearing of a baby from its mother’s womb. But once again, bastardizing the Bible to a progressive socialist is fine as long as it meets the agenda they have chosen.\nWhen Da Nang Dick Blumenthal was asked if abortions should be allowed for healthy babies in healthy mothers, he refused to answer. It is similar across the progressive socialist spectrum and the harridans of the feminist movement. When asked about the aspects of late-term abortion, they either change the subject or speak once again on “reproductive right.” I want to ask them if abortion should be continually used as a form of birth control because some woman could not keep her legs together or find effective birth control.\nThen there is Presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand, when asked why taxpayer funds should be used for abortion said It’s not your ( the citizens) decision whether to fund abortions. The government should fund abortions. I guess Gillibrand has forgotten who the government is and who she works for. She is also for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, passed to stop taxpayer funds being used for abortion. She considers abortion “reproductive care” a phrase always used by the progressive socialists which is a lie just in the statement. What about the reproductive care of the unborn child? Why is this a “right” when owning a gun will not be if the progressive socialist should gain power?\nEven Joe Biden has flipped on abortion leaving a position against Roe v Wade rather than stand for his principles. And a tyrant in the making, Kamala Harris has determined that any abortion laws passed by the states must be approved through the federal government Department of Justice. She seems to think killing an unborn child is a civil right, but refuses to discuss the civil rights of the child.\nAll the presidential progressive socialist candidates have spoken of no limitation to abortion as a fundamental right of the woman. They don’t seem to understand that 75% of Americans, including 61% of those who identify as “pro-choice” agree that abortion should be limited to the first three months, a tenet of the Roe v Wade decision. All the Presidential candidates on the progressives socialist wing of the Democrat Party and all Democrats have voted against the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act numerous times. Approaching 50 by the last count, the pro-choice party refuses to even let a viable baby outside the womb to live.\nAnne Hathaway, who is nothing more than an actress explicitly stated that the Alabama lawmakers who she claims are men restrict abortions to be complicit in the death of black women. Ignoring the fact that Planned Parenthood was founded by a racist eugenist, how can she blame men for a law instigated and signed into law by two women. State Representative Katrina Jackson for Louisiana spoke of Planned Parenthood declaring Pro-life crisis centers “fake clinics.” I suppose any clinic that doesn’t provide what is quickly becoming infanticide is a fake clinic. California attempted to pass laws that would force Pregnancy Crisis Centers into abortion referral centers.\nKatrina Jackson also condemned the aborting of black babies as a “modern-day genocide.” It has now been shown that more black babies are murdered by abortion than by violence disease and sickness combined. Rep. Jackson has been at the forefront of using social justice as a way to curb abortions. She speaks of advocacy for post birth resources being made available for those who decline abortion with particular emphasis on needy families. The progressive socialists and even some of the Presidential candidates have spoken of no help being provided by pro-life groups after a child is born.\nNothing is farther from the truth. One such group is the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA). Assistance from pro life groups on a local level is everywhere, from church groups to small organizations and individuals. They also provide over $100 million to pro-life Pregnancy Crisis Centers that have developed in most areas to finding housing and food for those who decide to have their child. I have seen many stories about Planned Parenthood workers, up to and including managers leaving because of the despicable practices that happen there. How many have left Pregnancy Crisis Centers for the same reason? The women that I know that work in those centers are caring and always look forward to helping to make life better for all they can.\nKristen Day, the director of Democrats for Life of America, a robust pro-life group has shown that one-third of Democrats oppose abortion but dare not say that because they would then be set upon by the radical leftists that demand everyone speak with one voice even though you may disagree.\nDoes Planned Parenthood care about their patients? Do they make a point to supply psychiatric assistance to combat depression, or do they allow them to just leave and go back to the same situation that caused them to get pregnant in the first place?\nThe language of abortion has also changed. To hide the reality of what abortion is the media in coordination with Planned Parenthood has changed the words used in the discussion. It has been such a large part of obfuscating what the reality is that NPR has put out talking points of what phrases and terms to use. Even the “pro-choice” moniker is a false flag. Choice for whom? Certainly not the innocent child. Pro-life is now a term not to be used on NPR. The reason for that is readily apparent. What about partial-birth abortion, or late-term abortion? They have been replaced with the clinical “intact dilation and extraction\" — a sterile reflection of ripping a viable baby from the mother’s womb. Of course, the words “baby” and “unborn” can no longer be used. They come too close to giving the baby the humanity it deserves. It shows the intense bias of NPR and other media that they can not speak in terms of humanity with any objectivity. Not stated by NPR is that in New York City alone the number of late-term abortions was 1,485 in 2015, while there were only 352 victims of murder.\nSo now, the country finds itself in a moral war over the rights of the unborn. Many states are passing infanticide bills, and in the case of Illinois allows full-term abortion in non-inspected clinics by non-doctors and no reporting requirements. Many states have attempted to force insurance companies to cover abortions and also to force a religious organization to cover abortions against the beliefs they hold.\nAnd as pertains to Hollywood, they are more worried about the treatment of chickens at McDonalds than they are about unborn children.",

        "article": "Trump borrows from the language of Hitler for anti-immigration speech in New Hampshire\n\nAs leaders in Washington negotiate a bipartisan immigration deal, former President Donald Trump used inflammatory language to demonize immigrants during a Saturday campaign speech in New Hampshire that echoed Adolf Hitler.\nTrump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for president in next year’s election, said that immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.” He pledged to toughen immigration laws, including by reinstating a travel ban from “terror-plagued countries” and requiring “strong ideological screening” for immigrants in the country without authorization.\n“They’re poisoning the blood of our country,” he told his supporters in Durham, New Hampshire, referring to immigrants.\n“That’s what they’ve done. They’ve poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world, not just in South America, not just the three or four countries that we think about, but all over the world. They’re coming into our country, from Africa, from Asia, all over the world. Nobody’s even looking at it.”\nHitler used similar language about Jews “poison[ing] the blood of others,” in “Mein Kampf,” his 1925 manifesto.\nTrump also praised authoritarian leaders in other countries, including North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he called “very nice” and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whom he called “highly respected.” And he endorsed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s criticism of President Joe Biden.\nNew Hampshire’s primary is Jan. 23, following the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15. Trump leads in polling in both states.\nIn a written statement, Biden’s reelection campaign said Trump “channeled” past and present dictators.\n“Tonight Donald Trump channeled his role models as he parroted Adolf Hitler, praised Kim Jong Un, and quoted Vladimir Putin while running for president on a promise to rule as a dictator and threaten American democracy,” campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a written statement.\nA spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment Monday.\nTrump’s remarks came as U.S. Senate leaders and the White House seek to work out an agreement on changes to immigration policy as part of a larger deal that includes a $100 billion supplemental request to fund aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and U.S. border security.\n\n‘Dog-whistling’\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is running in the GOP primary on an anti-Trump platform, called the comments “disgusting” during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday.\n“He’s disgusting,” Christie said. “And what he’s doing is dog-whistling to Americans who feel absolutely under stress and strain from the economy and the conflicts across the world. He’s dog-whistling to blame it on people from areas that don’t look like us.”\nChristie added that leading Republicans who continued to support Trump were complicit. He noted that almost 100 members of Congress have endorsed Trump and that presidential rival Nikki Haley of South Carolina called Trump fit to be president.\n“Nikki Haley should be ashamed of herself,” he said. “She’s part of the problem because she’s enabling him.”\nThe Haley campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nAuthoritarian rhetoric\nTrump has consistently degraded immigrants since his entrance into national politics in the 2016 presidential race and it continues to be among his most prominent themes as the campaign intensifies heading into 2024.\nIn the run-up to the 2016 election, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” and issued an executive order a week after entering office to block travel from certain Muslim-majority countries.\nThe executive order, and a successor, framed the policy as a national security issue in response to terror threats, but federal courts still blocked it for violating religious freedoms and other civil liberties. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld parts of the order, but Biden revoked it in full on his first day in office.\nIn recent weeks, Trump has made a string of comments that suggest he sees himself as an authoritarian leader.\nIn a November speech, he described his political opponents as “vermin,” another term used by Hitler and his World War II ally Benito Mussolini of Italy.\nAnd in a Fox News town hall this month, Trump responded to a request to dispel fears he would be a dictator in a second term by saying he would be a dictator only on his first day in office to take measures to control the border and expand fossil fuel development.\nHe emphasized that pledge Saturday.\n“My first day back at the White House, I will terminate every open-borders policy of the Biden administration, stop the invasion of our Southern border and begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” he said.\nRepublicans often use the word “invasion” to characterize the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has seen an increase in encounters with migrants at the U.S. Southern border, according to its data. In fiscal year 2022, there were nearly 2.4 million encounters with migrants, and in fiscal year 2023, which ended on Oct. 1, there were nearly 2.5 million encounters with migrants at the Southern border.\nTrump’s rhetoric throughout Saturday’s speech cast the former president as the leader of a “righteous crusade.”\n“This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country, it really is,” he said. “We’re engaged in a righteous crusade to liberate this nation from a corrupt political class that is waging war on American democracy like never before.\n“We’ve never seen anything like this before,” he continued. “If you put me back in the White House, their reign will be over and America will be a free nation once again. We are not a free nation.”",

        "article": "AOC: GOP Would Rather Sacrifice Child Labor Laws Than Allow Legal Immigration\n\nRepublicans “would rather roll back child labor laws … than allow immigrants into their community,” she said.\n\nRepublicans are aiming to erode legal immigration pathways as part of their latest attacks on immigration, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) warned this week as the White House negotiates an immigration deal with the GOP to prevent a government shutdown.\nOn social media, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted a portion of a House Oversight Committee hearing on immigration from Wednesday, emphasizing that conservatives, amid their fear mongering and racist rhetoric on immigration, often ignore that welcoming immigration policies typically have a stimulating effect on economies.\n“Historically, the United States has economically outperformed other countries in part due to our welcoming of immigrants,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Republicans would like you to believe that they support legal immigration, but today, they launched an attack on legal immigration pathways.”\nIn the clip of her remarks at the hearing, she asks Cato Institute associate director of Immigration Studies David J. Bier, who is critical of the conservative crackdown on immigration, how countries typically fare when they close their borders as Republicans are trying to do. Bier brought up the example of Japan, which in recent years has been forced to accept more immigrants to address acute labor shortages after many years of being one of the most restrictive wealthy countries on immigration policy.\nOcasio-Cortez went on to highlight similar labor shortages that are currently cropping up in the U.S. — but said that Republicans would rather put children in danger by eroding child labor laws to fill jobs.\n“Many of these Republican legislatures would rather roll back child labor laws and put 11 and 13 year olds back in the workplace than allow immigrants into their community and do what they’ve always done,” she said.\nRather, Congress must back policy “that can be documented, that people can get a job, put a shirt on their back, support their kids without being a public charge, and defend the very soul of what it means to be an American,” she concluded.\nIndeed, while Republicans are seeking stricter — and deeply cruel — restrictions on illegal immigration at the southern border, they are also seeking to curtail a major policy known as humanitarian parole, which the Biden administration has been using to allow people in countries with unstable and dangerous conditions to fly straight to the U.S., rather than entering from the southern border.\nLast year, after announcing that the policy applied to immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, the administration allowed over 200,000 people into the U.S. under parole status, which does not typically provide pathways to permanent residence. But it has still historically provided relief to people from countries in dire crises, often brought on by U.S. military intervention, with humanitarian parole being used to admit people from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in the 1970s, Iraq in the 1990s, and Afghanistan in 2021, for instance.\nIndeed, a recent FWD.us report found that roughly 1.1 million immigrants on parole between 2021 and 2023 were a major boon to a wide variety of industries like construction, transportation, manufacturing, health care, and other fields that have been experiencing shortages. The research found that this section of the workforce collectively reduced the number of open job positions in industries with shortages by a third from early 2022 to the end of 2023.\nWhile humanitarian parole has helped solve labor shortage issues and been a lifeline for many immigrants, Republicans in recent government funding deal discussions are seeking to limit the administration’s use of the policy — despite their protestations in public that they welcome legal immigration, as Ocasio-Cortez pointed out.\nRepublicans also put their cruelty on immigration policy on display during the hearing. At one point, one Republican representative said that “we want family separation” in order to supposedly ensure that children who are separated from their parents are actually with their parents — a baffling admission based on a narrative that is almost entirely removed from the horrific realities of family separation at the border.\nDemocrats in the hearing said that Republicans’ immigration policy isn’t based on humane and strategic solutions, but rather on creating more issues for immigrants and crises at the southern border in order to score political points.\n“It has become obvious that [Donald] Trump’s party doesn’t want immigration solutions at the border, they want immigration problems to run against,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) said.",

        "article": "Erdogan is Expelling Syrian refugees to Al Qaeda-controlled Areas\n\nThe Turkish madman Erdogan is proceeding with his plot to force-expel tens of thousands of Syrian refugees from Turkey into Al Qaeda-controlled areas in northern Syria along with up to a million terrorists and their families who pledged allegiance to his anti-Islamic Muslim Brotherhood doctrine serving the US-sponsored ‘Greater Israel Project‘ in the region.\nMore than 34,000 ‘unwanted’ Syrian refugees in Turkey were collected, packed onto buses, and deported to Azaz, they are settled in properties owned by other Syrians who were uprooted from their homes and forced to flee for their lives from the Turkish invading armies of uniformed and non-uniformed Jannisaries of the neo-Ottoman caliph wannabe.\nNo official figures were released and no proper count of how many al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists with their families were gathered from all sides of the planet including a large percentage of Chinese Uighurs and Turkic-speaking Central Asians were also settled in the regions under the control of the soldiers of Satan in northern Syria.\nThe following report by the Lebanese channel Al Mayadeen sheds some light on the unwanted Syrian refugees sent by the Turkish madman into Azaz in the northwestern countryside of Aleppo.\n\nTranscript:\nDozens of Syrians are on a forced return trip from Turkey to Azaz, a trip the Turkish immigration authorities wanted under cover of darkness, those expelled deny that they have done anything that requires expulsion.\nA Syrian refugee deported from Turkey to Azaz: What is the Turkish government doing? what does it want? Do you want to deport me? It doesn’t want me to stay in Turkey, okay, why are you deporting me with my sons?\nBut complex political calculations go beyond their wishes, calculations within a declared Turkish project to deport one million Syrians inside the Syrian borders under the title of the safe zone.\nPolitical Analyst: The first motive is related to the Turkish interior because the Turkish regime and the Justice and Development Party seek to re-polarize its popularity before the municipal and presidential elections in 2023 and say that it is ridding the Turkish interior of these Syrians.\nThe Turkish media machine does not stop promoting the ‘safe zone’, the AKP project within the internal party competition, a competition that turned the Syrians into an electoral card years ago in embracing and helping them under the titles of brotherhood, and today in getting rid of what competing Turkish parties and political forces see as an economic, social and security burden.\nAwni Al-Homsi – researcher in international relations: The deportation process is taking place today in a systematic manner by the Turkish regime, perhaps it will find supporters for this process, although it is fully aware that all conditions are not available for any military action, not to mention that this act is an occupation act with all its elements and is rejected at the international level and even within the environment that it seeks to establish in this region.\nThe deportation of Syrians from Turkey is taking place at an escalating pace, in the implementation of the decisions of the Turkish President. More than 34,000 people were deported during the first six months of the year under the pretext of legal violations.\nAny solution to the problem of Syrian refugees in Turkey appears in vain without opening a direct dialogue or through Moscow and Tehran with Damascus, which may prevent the threat and threat of a Turkish military operation whose essence is the assault on Syrian territory.\nMuhammad Al-Khidr, Damascus – Al-Mayadeen\nEnd of transcript.\n\nImagine your town or neighborhood invaded by head-chopper radicals, killing, maiming, raping, and lynching your neighbors, expelling you from your home, herding you and your family, or what’s left of them, into the same country that sponsored those terrorists, years later, and after you start all over again to build your life, your children get accustomed to the place they grew up in, you and they get expelled again but this time into another city of your origin country to live under the same terrorists you fled from or those who expelled you from your house in the first place.\nImagine now, your grown-up sons are forced to join the ranks of those terrorists, your girls and little boys might get raped any moment and you’re living on the property of someone else who faced a similar fate as you did and will come back to retrieve their homes you’re occupying any time soon or in the future, yes, Israel 2.0 and the plight of the Palestinian refugees all over again but now you’re the one living that plight.\nWe’re truly living in a world of jungle, not a world ruled by international law and the agreed Chapter that formed the United Nations, it’s a world where weirdos, psychopaths, even spoiled children, and demented old pedophile men rule some of the world’s larger countries and dictate their evilness and non-values over the rest of the world.",

        "article": "A Tale of Two Walls\n\nCongress prefers the Israeli version\n\nThe demand of President Donald Trump that congress should appropriate money to build a wall securing the nation’s southern border has resulted in the longest federal government shutdown in history with no end in sight. There is considerable opposition to the wall based on two quite different perceptions of border security. The generally “progressive” view is that there is no border threat at all, that the thousands of migrants heading for the U.S. can be assimilated and indeed should be allowed entry because of U.S. government policies in Central America that have created the ruined states that the would-be immigrants have been fleeing.\nThere is certainly some truth to that argument, though it suggests that the United States should essentially abandon sovereignty over its own territory, which most Americans would reject. The alternative viewpoint, which has a much broader bipartisan constituency, consists of those who do feel that border security is a national priority but are nevertheless critical of building a wall, which will be expensive, possibly ineffective and environmentally damaging. They prefer other options, to include increased spending on the border guards, more aggressive enforcement against existing illegals and severe punishment of businesses in the U.S. that hire anyone not possessing legal documentation. Some also have argued in favor of a national ID issued only to citizens or legal permanent residents that would have to be produced by anyone seeking employment or government services.\nWhether the wall will ever be built is questionable, but one thing that is certain is that there is more than enough hypocrisy regarding it to go around. Democratic Presidents including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when campaigning have called for better border security, as have Democratic Congressional leaders who are now smelling blood and attacking Trump for seeking to do what they have long at least theoretically sought.\nApart from that, many of the Democrats who are currently criticizing the southern border wall on moral grounds have failed to apply the same standard to another infamous wall, that which is being built by Israel. Israel’s “separation wall” is arguably being constructed at least in part using “aid” and charitable money provided by Washington while also being enabled politically by the U.S. government’s acquiescence to the Israeli violations of international law. And if the moral argument for not having a wall to aid suffering refugees has any meaning, it would be many times more so applied to the Israeli wall, which is an instrument in the maintenance of apartheid in areas under Israeli control while also making permanent the stateless status of the more than one million Palestinian refugees, far more in number than the would-be immigrants marching through Mexico.\nThe Israeli wall is at many points larger and more intimidating than that planned by Trump, and it is also designed to physically and economically devastate the Palestinian population adjacent to it. Israel’s wall is undeniably far more damaging than anything being considered for placement along the U.S.-Mexican border as it operates as both a security measure and a tool for confiscating more Arab land by including inside the barrier illegal West Bank settlements.\nThere are both physical similarities and differences relating to the two walls. Judging from prototypes, Trump currently appears to favor prefabricated mostly metal sections with barbed wire coils on top that would be high and intimidating enough to deter climbing over. The sections would be set in foundations sufficiently deep to deter most tunneling and there would be sensors at intervals to alert guards to other attempts to penetrate the barrier. Israel’s wall varies in terms of structural material, including large concrete blocks 28 feet high in some areas while other less populated stretches that are considered low security make do with multiple lines of barbed wire and sensors. It is interesting to note that some Israeli companies have apparently expressed interest in building the Mexico wall and, as one of the many perks Israel receives from congress includes the right to bid on U.S. government contracts, they might well wind up as a contractors or subcontractors if the barrier is ever actually built.\nAs noted above, the principal difference between the U.S. wall and that of Israel is that the American version is all on U.S. land and is engineered to more or less run in a straight line along the border. The Israeli version is nearly 90% built on Palestinian land and, as it is designed to create facts on the West Bank, it does not run in a straight line, instead closing off some areas to the Palestinians by surrounding Arab villages. It therefore keeps people in while also keeping people out, so it is not strictly speaking a security barrier. Indeed, some Israeli security experts have stated their belief that the wall has been only a minor asset in preventing violence directed by Palestinians against Israelis.\nIf the Israeli wall had followed the Green Line that separated Israel proper from Palestinian land it would be only half the estimated 440 miles long that it will now be upon completion. The extra miles are accounted for by the deep cuts of as much as 11 miles into the West Bank, isolating about 9% of it and completely enclosing 25,000 Palestinian Arabs from areas nominally controlled by the Palestinian Authority. One often cited victim of the barrier is the Palestinian town of Qalqilyah, with a population of 45,000, which is enclosed on all sides by a wall that in some sections measures more than 25 feet high. Qalqilyah is only accessible through an Israeli controlled military checkpoint on the main road from the east and a tunnel on the south side that links the town to the adjacent village of Habla.\nThe wall is therefore only in part a security measure while also being a major element in the Israeli plan to gradually acquire as much of the West Bank as possible – perhaps all of it – for Israeli settlers. It is a form of collective punishment based on religion to make life difficult for local people and eventually drive them from their homes.\nThe human costs for the Palestinians have consequently been high. A United Nations 2005 report states that : … it is difficult to overstate the humanitarian impact of the Barrier. The route inside the West Bank severs communities, people’s access to services, livelihoods and religious and cultural amenities. In addition, plans for the Barrier’s exact route and crossing points through it are often not fully revealed until days before construction commences. This has led to considerable anxiety amongst Palestinians about how their future lives will be impacted… The land between the Barrier and the Green Line constitutes some of the most fertile in the West Bank. It is currently the home for 49,400 West Bank Palestinians living in 38 villages and towns.”\nAmnesty International in a 2004 report observed: “The fence/wall, in its present configuration, violates Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law… Since the summer of 2002 the Israeli army has been destroying large areas of Palestinian agricultural land, as well as other properties, to make way for a fence/wall which it is building in the West Bank. In addition to the large areas of particularly fertile Palestinian farmland that have been destroyed, other larger areas have been cut off from the rest of the West Bank by the fence/wall. The fence/wall is not being built between Israel and the Occupied Territories but mostly (close to 90%) inside the West Bank, turning Palestinian towns and villages into isolated enclaves, cutting off communities and families from each other, separating farmers from their land and Palestinians from their places of work, education and health care facilities and other essential services. This in order to facilitate passage between Israel and more than 50 illegal Israeli settlements located in the West Bank.”\nOf course, the situation has become far worse for Palestinians since the two reports dating from 2004 and 2005. Israel has accelerated its settlement construction and the wall has expanded and shifted to accommodate those changes, making life impossible for the indigenous population.\nAny pushback from the United States has been rare to nonexistent, with successive administrations only occasionally mentioning that the settlements themselves are “troubling” or a “complication” vis-à-vis a peace settlement. The first direct criticism of the wall itself took place in 2003, when the Bush administration briefly considered reducing loan guarantees to discourage its construction. Then Secretary of State Colin Powell remarked “A nation is within its rights to put up a fence if it sees the need for one. However, in the case of the Israeli fence, we are concerned when the fence crosses over onto the land of others.”\nOn May 25, 2005, Bush repeated his concerns, noting that “I think the wall is a problem. And I discussed this with Ariel Sharon. It is very difficult to develop confidence between the Palestinians and Israel with a wall snaking through the West Bank.” In a letter to Sharon he stated that it “should be a security rather than political barrier, should be temporary rather than permanent and therefore not prejudice any final status issues including final borders, and its route should take into account, consistent with security needs, its impact on Palestinians not engaged in terrorist activities.”\nCongress is, of course, Israeli occupied territory so its response was directed against Powell and Bush in support of anything Israel chose to do. Then Senator Joe Lieberman complained “The administration’s threat to cut aid to Israel unless it stops construction of a security fence is a heavy-handed tactic. The Israeli people have the right to defend themselves from terrorism, and a security fence may be necessary to achieve this.”\nIn 2005, Senator Hillary Clinton declared her support for the wall by claiming that the Palestinian Authority had failed to fight terrorism. “This is not against the Palestinian people. This is against the terrorists. The Palestinian people have to help to prevent terrorism. They have to change the attitudes about terrorism.” Senator Charles Schumer, also from New York, added “As long as the Palestinians send terrorists onto school buses and to nightclubs to blow up people, Israel has no choice but to build the Security Wall.”\nSo, for many in Washington a legal and relatively apolitical wall by the United States to protect its border is a horrible prospect while the Israeli version built on someone else’s land with the intention to damage the local Arab population as much as possible is perfectly fine. The reality is that America’s Establishment, which is dominated by veneration of Israel for a number of reasons, is completely hypocritical, more prepared to criticize actions taken by the United States even when those actions are justified than they are to condemn Israeli actions that amount to crimes against humanity. That is the reality and it is playing out in front of us right now.",

That has prompted the president to retaliate with the government shutdown, which he triggered by not signing off on funding to swaths of departments.\n\"I'm here today to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border,\" Trump said in his address.\nTrump describes the US-Mexico border -- for decades a magnet for migrants and asylum seekers, as well as a major drug smuggling route -- as overwhelmed, posing a threat to US national security.\nDemocrats, who accuse Trump of using his illegal immigration crackdown to score political points with his right-wing base, spurned the latest negotiating offer as soon as it was leaked in the media prior to the speech.\n\"His proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives,\" said Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives and the face of Democratic opposition to Trump. \"They are a non-starter.\"\nHowever, Trump's speech was the latest sign that both sides may slowly be grasping for a way out of an impasse that has turned into a test of brute political strength.\nThe New York Times reported that Democrats have added more than $1 billion to their previous offer of $1.3 billion for new border security, even if that is still far short of Trump's $5.7 billion figure.\nThe Times said roughly half the additional $1 billion being offered by Democrats would go to improve infrastructure at ports of entry, and the other half would fund 75 new immigration judges -- but with no new money for a wall.\nWhile each side waits for the other to blink, some 800,000 federal employees have been caught up in the shutdown, waiting for paychecks. They include members of the Coast Guard, FBI and airport security staff.\nAll are expected to receive back wages once the shutdown ends, but in the meantime, many have had difficulty paying bills or even feeding their families.\nThe partial government shutdown -- a disruptive political weapon almost unique to the American system -- began on December 22 and is now the longest ever.\nWhile polls show more Americans blame Trump and the Republicans than the Democrats, both sides are feeling pressure, as disgust rises across the country with the paralyzed political leadership in Washington.\nAdding to the sense of chaos, the dispute has turned deeply personal, with Trump and Pelosi exchanging what to many seem like almost playground-level jibes.\nAfter Pelosi suggested shelving Trump's upcoming State of the Union address before Congress -- one of the key set-piece political appearances of the year -- the president abruptly revoked her right to use an air force plane for a trip to Afghanistan. Both cited difficulties caused by the shutdown as justification.\nOn Saturday, Trump said Pelosi \"is under total control of the radical left.\"",

Speaking in the early-voting state of New Hampshire, Trump said: \"All over the world they’re pouring into our country.\"\nThe border security negotiations appear to be deeply complex for the Senate. While Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat from Connecticut said: \"Everyday we get closer, not farther away,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said senators don’t want to be \"jammed\" by a last-minute compromise reached by negotiators.\n\"We’re not anywhere close to a deal,\" Graham said Sunday on NBC 'Meet the Press.' He predicted the deliberations will go into next year.\nThe Biden administration faces an increasingly difficult political situation as global migration is on a historic rise. The president is being berated daily by Republicans, led by Trump, as border crossings have risen to levels that make even some in Biden’s own Democratic Party concerned.\nThe senators and the White House appear to be focused on ways to limit the numbers of migrants who are eligible for asylum at the border, primarily by toughening the requirements to qualify for their cases to go forward.\nThe talks have also focused removing some migrants who have already been living in the U.S. without full legal status, and on ways to temporarily close the U.S.-Mexico border to some crossings if they hit a certain metric, or threshold. Arrests of migrants have topped 10,000 on some days.\nThere has also been discussion about limiting existing programs that have allowed groups of arrivals from certain countries to temporarily enter the U.S. while they await proceedings about their claims. Decades ago, those programs welcomed Vietnamese arrivals and others, and have since been opened to Ukrainians, Afghans and a group that includes Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians.\nMeanwhile, Biden’s massive $110 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and other security needs is hanging in the balance. Many, but not all, Republicans have soured on helping Ukraine amid its war against Russia.",

They blame Biden's policies for an influx of immigrants into the United States.\nJohnson said after the meeting that he told Biden the United States needed substantive policy change on immigration and called the situation at the border a \"national security and humanitarian catastrophe.\"\nRepublicans have hammered Biden over immigration and the issue has become a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential election. Biden, a Democrat, is expected to face Republican Donald Trump, an immigration hard-liner who is his party's presidential front-runner, in the November election.\nThere were 10.5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in 2021, according to the Pew Research Center. Biden sought to reform the immigration system with proposed legislation at the beginning of his term, but it was opposed by Republicans. The White House is open to new restrictions on who can seek U.S. asylum and expanding deportation authority, but many Democrats oppose such measures.\nBiden has requested $61.4 billion in additional funding to help supply Ukraine with weapons and replenish U.S. stocks as it nears the two-year mark of its war with Russia. The funds sought for Ukraine is part of a \"supplemental\" request that also includes $14.3 billion for Israel and $13.6 billion for border protection.\nJohnson said he wanted clarity on how the war in Ukraine would be brought to an end. \"We need the questions answered about the strategy, about the endgame and about the accountability for the precious treasure of the American people,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\nA Johnson aide said the speaker agreed on the need to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but felt that securing the U.S. border was a higher priority.\nOn his X (formerly Twitter) account, Johnson posted on Wednesday: \"If only the President focused on out sovereignty first...\" referring to Biden's quest for aid to Ukraine.\nTop U.S. Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said there was agreement in the meeting about tackling both the border and funding for Ukraine.\n\"There was remarkable consensus in that room. Just about every person in that room - Democrat, Republican, House, Senate - talked about the importance of aiding Ukraine,\" Schumer said.\n\"Everyone in the room also talked about we had to do something about the border. It's broken and President Biden said he knows that and wants to make really significant change on the border.\"",

        "article": "French health minister resigns over controversial immigration law\n\nFrance’s health minister resigned as the government of President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday sought to quell a party revolt over the passing of tough new immigration legislation backed by the far-right.\nFollowing 18 months of wrangling over one of the flagship reforms of Macron’s second-term, both chambers of parliament backed the controversial legislation on Tuesday, with Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) endorsing the bill in a move some media dubbed a “kiss of death”.\nAround a quarter of the 251 lawmakers in Macron’s camp voted against the bill or abstained and several left-wing ministers have registered their opposition to the bill.\nHealth Minister Aurelien Rousseau resigned, although there were no immediate signs of other ministers following suit despite fears overnight.\nRousseau did not attend a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning and would be replaced on a temporary basis by junior minister Agnes Firmin Le Bodo, government spokesman Olivier Veran said.\n“There is no ministerial revolt,” he added.\nMacron was expected to address the reform in a television interview on Wednesday evening, while Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne sought to put on a brave face, saying the adoption of the law had not provoked a “crisis in the majority”.\nSpeaking on France Inter, Borne admitted that some of the provisions were probably unconstitutional, adding that the text “would have to evolve” once it had been examined by the Constitutional Council after referral by Macron.\n“We wanted to pass a law on useful, effective measures that our fellow citizens expect, with two objectives: To remove more quickly and more effectively those who have no right to be in France, and to better integrate those we choose to welcome,” she said.\nAt Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting, Macron declared that there are in the text “things that I don’t like but which are not against our values”, a participant, who asked not to be named, told AFP.\n\n‘Deep scars’\nThe text of the bill had to be hardened under pressure from the right, but Borne stressed that in the end the ruling party did not need the support of Le Pen’s far-right RN to push the bill through.\nBeating Le Pen to secure five more years in 2022, Macron has vowed to stave off her rise, but he has been accused of pandering to the far-right to push through his reform agenda.\n“The immigration law will leave deep scars,” said French right-wing daily Le Figaro, adding that Macron “had lost on all fronts”.\nLiberation, the left-wing newspaper, for its part spoke of a “moral defeat” for his party.\nFrance has a long tradition of welcoming refugees and immigrants, but a rise in the number of asylum seekers, a chronic affordable-housing shortage, and a cost-of-living crisis have worsened social tensions in the country.\nDozens of NGOs have slammed what they described as potentially the “most regressive” immigration law in decades.\nA key element of the law is that social security benefits for foreigners will now be conditioned on five years of presence in France, or 30 months for those who have jobs.\nMigration quotas can also now be agreed and there are measures for dual-national convicts being stripped of French nationality.\n\n‘Disgusting victory’\n“It’s a total victory for the ideas defended by Marine Le Pen,” said far-right lawmaker Jean-Philippe Tanguy.\nThe head of the conservative Republicans (LR) Party, Eric Ciotti, hailed the adoption of the law as a “historic victory for the right”.\nThe left-wing opposition slammed the measures.\nThe head of the Socialist deputies in the Assembly, Boris Vallaud, accused the government of “giving in to the most rancid ideas”.\nRadical left-wing leader Jean-Luc Melenchon denounced a “disgusting victory”.\nA hot-button issue in France, as elsewhere in Europe, immigration regularly inflames the political class.\nOn Wednesday, EU countries and lawmakers reached an agreement on an overhaul of the bloc’s laws on handling asylum-seekers and migrants, officials said.\nThe issue has taken on a harder political edge in Europe in recent years with the rise of nationalist anti-immigrant parties in several EU countries, including Italy, Sweden and The Netherlands.",

        "article": "An immigration weake-up call\n\nFor around a week in late June, Western media were obsessed with the fate of the Titan, a small submersible carrying a few billionaires and others to the sunken Titanic and later found to have imploded within hours of beginning its descent. Meanwhile, a boat carrying some 750 economic refugees capsized off the Greek coast, killing hundreds who had boarded in Libya after making perilous journeys from places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria. Pakistan declared a national day of mourning for its citizens lost at sea. But the West paid hardly any notice.\nOf course, it is unfair to fault the press for responding to the demands of its audience. The relatively scant coverage of the migrants’ tragedy is symptomatic of a larger tendency to ignore the plight of those who happen to have been born in less privileged parts of the world. The mood has changed since the 2015 refugee crisis, when chilling photos of a migrant boy who had washed up on the Turkish coast elicited outrage and a vigorous response from policymakers in rich countries. In the intervening years, the Western public has become inured to such images, more often looking inward, or focusing on other priorities.\nTrue, a cynic might say that the intense coverage of the 2015 refugee crisis was motivated less by idealism than by pragmatic concerns about Europe being overwhelmed by millions of people fleeing from violence. But even if that was the case, the same concerns dictate that advanced economies pay more attention to the developing world’s problems today.\nMost governments around the world have recognised that they can no longer ignore climate change and other environmental damage. But ignoring the huge gap in living standards between the Global North and South has similarly become unsustainable. Owing to advances in communications technology and access to social media, the poor today are keenly aware of the vast differences between their lives and those of people living in rich countries. As long as these differences remain, they will keep pushing north in search of a better future. No border, no wall, and no sea will keep them where they are. The ongoing immigration crisis at the United States’ southern border and the continuing drama on the seas around Greece and Italy have made that clear.\nBut the quest for a better life is just the supply side of the equation. On the demand side, labour-market shortages have created a strong incentive to bring people into advanced economies to do the work that natives no longer do. In the absence of well-considered immigration policies that can satisfy this need, reckless smugglers have filled the void.\nThe labour-market shortages in advanced economies are not some temporary or short-run phenomenon. In the US, a recent Brookings Institution study documents a shortfall of 2.4 million workers as of December 2022, relative to the 12-month average ending in February 2020. Most of this decline would have happened without the pandemic, owing to changes in the age and education of the population. But there was also a decline in the average weekly hours worked, producing an additional labor-supply shortfall equivalent to another 2.4 million people.\nThis reduction in work hours cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19 or the fear of long COVID. While its causes are not yet fully understood, a re-evaluation of work-life balance seems a plausible hypothesis. In any case, the bottom line is that labor shortages experienced in the aftermath of the pandemic are likely to persist, both in the US and in Europe, where low fertility and aging populations present similar demographic challenges.\nWhile advances in automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence may mitigate some labour-supply challenges, not every job can be replaced by a robot or a computer-generated service. Many of the jobs that remain in demand are in sectors like construction, housekeeping, health care and hospitality, where the work is usually not pleasant or glamorous. If Americans and Europeans are unwilling to take these positions, it makes sense to offer them to motivated, hardworking immigrants. This is not about providing humanitarian assistance; it is just sound economic policy, especially at a time when repeated interest-rate hikes by central banks have not yet resolved one of the primary contributors to inflation: tight labour markets.\nA well-designed immigration policy that allows for the controlled entry of willing workers, and that helps integrate them into host countries, would go a long way toward easing labour-market tightness and preventing humanitarian tragedies caused by smugglers’ shameless exploitation of migrants and refugees. But policymakers will need to look beyond the next election cycle and rise above partisan political interests.\nAt the same time, it is neither possible nor desirable to move the entire populations of low-income countries to America and Europe, so it is imperative to reject short-sighted economic nationalism. Advanced economies must do more to address the huge imbalances that still exist across the world economy. Reducing global inequality is essential to a sustainable future.",

        "article": "Guilt and the Immigrants\n\nAngela Merkel took a shellacking in German regional elections a week ago, but she’s not about to get tougher on immigration, which is what provoked her bad results. She’s sticking with her open-door policy, even though it isn’t working very well. It is a typical feel-good policy that ignores reality: Merkel, and lots of other German leaders, want to prove that they are fine humanitarians, not the descendants of the Fuhrer. And so they “welcome” hundreds of thousands of refugees and are trying to turn them into good Europeans.\nAlas, most of the refugees—including the many who would really love to assimilate—can’t do that. Not primarily because they are culturally alien, but because they lack the wherewithal to work in modern Germany. They don’t speak or write the language; they don’t have the technical skills, like mathematics, necessary to get a job; and they don’t know how to live in a Western city. So, while the Germans give them apprenticeships to learn work skills, the immigrants drop out to the tune of about fifty percent. The dropouts collect unemployment. Bottom lines: the taxpayers are paying for unqualified refugees, don’t like it, and send that message to the chancellor.\nI’m old enough to remember the Los Angeles riots of 1992, when street gangs destroyed entire neighborhoods downtown. President George H.W. Bush went out to California to get advice from the locals, and one of the hot ideas of the moment was to empower the gangs, let them run businesses, and put their energy to work for the community. It sounded great, but only briefly. If memory serves me right (always a bit chancy), it was Peter Ueberroth who said “they can’t read or write, how in the world can they run a business?” So they went back to fighting, in which the thugs had advanced degrees.\nAssimilation is hard and slow and expensive; you can’t just wave a wand and transform third-world illiterates into productive Western citizens. Maybe in a generation or two it can be accomplished. My grandparents continued to speak Russian and Yiddish, their children mastered English, and some of them even went to college, but it wasn’t until my generation came along, born 40 years after the immigrants cleared Ellis Island, that you had kids who were totally immersed in American culture. And we’re the best at it. Germany’s numbers are off-puting. In about five years, ethnic Germans will constitute less than half the population (lots of Turks).\nMerkel’s policy, then, can be expected to fundamentally transform the makeup of her country, and it goes hand in hand with the original motivation for the creation of the eurozone (and hence the EU itself) in the first place. Helmut Kohl, the architect of the euro, accepted the negative stereotype of his people; he believed that, left to their own devices, the Germans would kill again. His great mission was the elimination of Germany from the map, the dissolution of Germany as an identifiable nation or people. The euro was, so to speak, the acid in which Germany—as symbolized by the deutsche mark—was to vanish, becoming just one piece of the new Europe.\nMerkel shares this vision. She and her followers are tortured by recent German history. They do not want to lead Europe, let alone play a primary role in the Western alliance. She fears her own impulses, and those she ascribes to her people. The immigration policy is a piece of that self-hating vision.\nI think this helps understand why Obama gets along better with Merkel than with most other traditional European allies. They share a very negative view of their national histories, they don’t think their nations are worthy of leading world events, they both have romantic notions about the peoples of failed countries (most certainly including the Middle East), and they prefer to play a secondary role in world affairs (aka “leading from behind).\nThat is why both have adopted immigration policies that may well fundamentally transform their countries in the immediate future. German and American taxpayers don’t like giving money to people who can’t make it on their own. The sympathetic intellectuals brand the critics “racists” or “chauvinists” or even “fascists,” but actually Merkel and Obama are provoking the citizens’ anger, by insisting on policies that fly in the face of reality.\nBoth are likely to provoke national decisions very much at odds with their own confused visions.",

        "article": "Michael Anton-Why do we Need More People in this Country, Anyway?\n\nAs Capitol Hill Republicans attempt for — what, the eighth? ninth? — time in the past two decades to jam through an amnesty that their voters have explicitly, loudly and repeatedly said they do not want, it’s worth asking a question that is rarely raised:\nDoes the United States — population 320 million and rising — need more people? If so, why?\nTo most ears, the question sounds blasphemous, which illustrates the rottenness of our immigration debate. Actually, “debate” is far too generous. One side has made sure that there is no debate. Good people want more immigration, and bad people object or raise questions. An inherently political issue has been effectively rendered religious, with the righteous on one side, sinners on the other.\nThe basic question remains. The pat answer over the past 20 years — “to do the jobs Americans just won’t do” — may seem to have some salience with a 3.9 percent unemployment rate. But that only further raises the question. After at least two decades of wage stagnation and even decline, now that we’ve finally reached the nirvana of full employment (and who knows how long it will last), why not take advantage of this tight labor market to raise wages across the board? Especially for the working and middle classes that got nowhere or even lost ground during the housing, finance and tech booms of recent years?\nJust about everyone knows the answer: because the business community does not like tight labor markets and the concomitant necessity to raise wages. That’s bad for the bottom line. The solution? More workers! And so the Chamber of Commerce annex — a.k.a. Capitol Hill Republicans — dutifully attempt to do their donors’ bidding at the expense of their voters’ interests.\nCritics of the Trump immigration policy that leads to separating families say it is “un-American.” They’re wrong.  (Kate Woodsome, Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)\nEconomists in league with big business got good at torturing data to “show” that immigration benefits the economy. But as demonstrated by Harvard University’s George Borjas, one of the nation’s leading economists on the topic, immigration is a net economic benefit to immigrants and to their employers. To workers already here, not so much.\nNo matter, because the Democrats are no longer the party of labor. Back when they were — in the prelapsarian Clinton years — they sought tight labor markets precisely for their efficacy in boosting lower-end wages. But today’s Democrats are the party of high class, high tech and high capital.\nThis glamour coalition is not big enough by itself to win elections. So the left has hoodwinked some (but, as the 2016 election shows, by no means all) low-income voters into thinking that their interests align with those of Wall Street and Silicon Valley oligarchs.\nIt’s clear what the oligarchs get out of an endless influx of cheap labor. What the Democratic Party gets is also clear: more voters, and with them the tantalizing possibility of turning the country as irreversibly blue as Democratic policies have already done to New York, California and many other states.\nDemocrats used to be coy about this. The 2002 blockbuster “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” by John B. Judis, presented demographic change as an inevitability, not a deliberate plot to rig elections. But now, for the first time facing real pushback from those whose interests more immigration does not serve, the left is more open in exhorting their side and demonizing the other. Hence this year’s “How Democracies Die,” by Steven Levitsky, states openly that immigration favors Democrats, so the more the better. It also construes any opposition as (of course) racist.\nAnother argument for more people is to point to falling birthrates among the native-born. In fact, the United States remains near the top of birthrates in the developed world. Regardless, consider that immigration not only lowers wages but also raises housing prices by increasing demand and stresses public schools by adding non-English-speaking students. And as such factors worsen, research suggests that people are putting off marriage — which reduces birthrates.\nRelated is the claim that more people are necessary to solve our looming entitlement crisis. This quickly falls apart once you think it through. In 1967, future Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson favorably compared Social Security to a Ponzi scheme, arguing that it will be sustainable because younger people will always outnumber retirees. But does anyone really believe the United States — or any country — is capable of sustaining population growth without end? Somehow, the United States needs to find a way to meet its fiscal commitments without stuffing the land beyond the bursting point.\nSo again: Why do we need more people? For the extra traffic congestion? More crowded classrooms? Longer emergency room and Transportation Security Administration lines? Higher greenhouse-gas emissions?\nWe know how more immigration benefits big business and the Democratic Party. No one has yet convincingly explained how it benefits the American people as a whole. That’s the foremost consideration that should drive our immigration debate, and that’s what should determine our immigration policy.",

        "article": "Ramaswamy Vows to Boot US-Born Children of Illegal Immigrants: 'The Family Unit Will Be Deported'\n\nThere is a right way and a wrong way to enter this country. Recently, hundreds and thousands of illegal immigrants have been crossing the border daily — and they are doing it the wrong way.\nPresident Joe Biden and his administration are welcoming them through the door with open arms, instead of shutting it in their faces and telling them to go home.\nSounds harsh? Not as harsh as what the American people now must do to cope with the flood of illegals that has crossed our borders. The economic and societal implications are becoming insurmountable.\nEvery state has been affected. The few Republican governors that have fought back, like Republican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida, have quickly learned how left-wing our judicial system has become. Illegal is no longer hard-n-fast, rather it is a sliding scale.\nThat alone is destroying the United States. There isn’t a state among us that isn’t receiving illegal immigrants by hook or by crook and dealing with the repercussions. Even New York City has had enough.\nDemocratic Mayor Eric Adams’ recent remarks demonstrated just how bad things have gotten in his neck of the woods. Frankly, if he’s complaining, you know it has to be bad as he was a strong sanctuary city proponent.\n[X post (former Twitter)] #BREAKING : Mayor Eric Adams of New York City declares that the city is facing a significant influx of illegal immigrants who are crossing US border from various parts of the world. “The city we knew, we’re about to lose”.#Newyork #Mayor #EricAdams #immigrants #illegal… [video] — mishikasingh (@mishika_singh)\nEnter Vivek Ramaswamy, Republican presidential candidate.\nRamaswamy’s own family immigrated to the United States, too, but legally. He knows the scope of the path in which to take because his family took it. Like many other legal immigrants, he has become enormously frustrated with the leniency the current administration has had regarding the overtaking of the border by illegal immigrants. He is tired of undocumented immigrants abusing the system and skipping the line to enter the United States, especially in the face of his personal history with it.\nIn a recent interview following a town hall and shared by NBC News, Ramaswamy remarked on his disapproval of how this broken system was impacting the welfare of our nation. He addressed how he and his administration would handle the crisis.\nHis solution included deporting illegal immigrants without apology. Very clear in his desire to keep families together, Ramaswamy declared that under his administration, “The family unit will be deported.”\nWhen asked if this would include deporting children who had been born in the United States to illegal immigrant parents, Ramaswamy gave a one word answer: “Yes.”\nRamaswamy mentioned differing views on the rights of children born in this nation to illegal immigrant parents, claiming “There are legally contested questions under the 14th Amendment of whether the child of an illegal immigrant is indeed a child who enjoys birthright citizenship.” Certainly, how the 14th Amendment is ultimately interpreted would impact what Ramaswamy or any other president could do.\nThe 14th Amendment reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Under the present administration’s interpretation, the 14th Amendment makes these children American citizens. However, Ramaswamy interprets the 14th Amendment to mean that one isn’t necessarily an automatic citizen of the United States if their parents broke the law in being here and they just happened to be born during that time.\nThere would be enormous pushback in deporting these kids. That said, how long can we allow the rewarding of our laws being broken before our nation collapses? It needs to end. In this, Ramaswamy is courageous enough to say what so many Americans are feeling. Not just Conservative Americans, mind you.\nThe U.S. needs to oust these illegal immigrants from our nation and send them back home — together, as a family.\nAmericans shouldn’t pay for illegal immigrants’ purposeful decision to break the law. I feel for the kids, but that soft heart won’t save our country. It will sink it, leaving no country for them to even come back to and to become naturalized citizens through the legal process.\nVivek Ramaswamy continues to clearly communicate who he is and what his presidency would look like. His secret to climbing in the polls is simply a “No guts, no glory approach.” Props to him!",

        "article": "Scourge of Illegal Immigrants? Sweden PM to Seek Army Help to End Gang Violence\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson vowed Thursday to defeat criminal gangs with the military’s help after a surge of violence that has killed a growing number of children and innocent victims.\nKristersson said he would meet Friday with the national chief of police and the commander in chief of the military “to see how the armed forces can help the police fight the gangs.”\nThe Scandinavian country has in recent years been in the grip of a bloody conflict between gangs fighting over arms and drug trafficking, which has escalated over vendettas between the gangs.\nApartment buildings and homes across the country are frequently rocked by explosions, while shootings, once limited to disadvantaged areas, have become regular occurrences in public places in the usually tranquil, wealthy country.\n“We are going to hunt down the gangs. We are going to defeat the gangs,” Kristersson said in a televised address to the nation Thursday evening, after three people were killed overnight on Wednesday.\nAn 18-year-old man was shot dead at a crowded football pitch early Wednesday evening in a well-off Stockholm suburb, police said.\nA second shooting took place around midnight in another Stockholm suburb, injuring two people, one of whom later died, police said, adding that three suspects had been arrested in that case.\nSeveral hours later, an explosion near the university town of Uppsala, 70 kilometres north of Stockholm, damaged five homes and killed a 25-year-old woman with no known connection to the gangs, according to police.\nThe surge in killings has shocked Swedes.\n“Crime has reached unprecedented levels. The situation is very serious in Uppsala, and in the rest of the country,” Uppsala police official Catarina Bowall told reporters.\n\n‘No other European country has this’\nAccording to a tally by Swedish public television SVT, 12 people have been killed in shootings and explosions in September, the deadliest month in the past four years.\nOne of the dead was a 13-year-old boy whose body was found dumped in a wooded area. Prosecutors said they believed he was a victim of the gang violence.\n“An increasing number of children and completely innocent people are affected by this extreme violence,” Kristersson said.\n“Sweden has never seen anything like this. No other country in Europe is seeing anything like this.”\nHe said serious organised crime had risen over the past decade “due to naivete”.\n“An irresponsible immigration policy and failed integration led us here,” the conservative leader said.\n“Swedish legislation was not designed for gang wars and child soldiers. But we’re changing that now,” he said.\nHe noted new legislation entering into force in the coming days enabling police to wiretap gangs, as well as plans for body searches in some areas, harsher sentences for repeat offenders and double sentences for certain crimes.\n“We’ll put them on trial. If they are Swedish citizens they will be locked away with long prison sentences, and if they are foreigners they will be deported,” he said.\n“We are going to deport foreigners who move in criminal gang circles even if they haven’t committed a crime,” he said.\nHe said Sweden also needed to introduce surveillance cameras in public places and build special prisons for teenage criminals.\nIn 2022, Sweden registered 391 shootings, 62 of which were fatal.",

Betty McCollum issued a statement through her congressional office on Saturday that denounced the violence in Israel without naming Hamas. She said, “These appear to be serious acts of war, and war is never the answer.”\nBoth U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith issued strong statements on Saturday saying that America stands with Israel following what they characterized as terrorist attacks by Hamas.\nReps. Brad Finstad, Dean Phillips, Angie Craig, Tom Emmer, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber each issued their own statements strongly condemning the Hamas attacks and pledging support for Israel.\nWhile Rep. Omar joined her congressional colleagues on Saturday in condemning the violence, she qualified her comments by adding, “Such senseless violence will only repeat the back and forth cycle we’ve seen, which we cannot allow to continue. We need to call for de-escalation and ceasefire. I will keep advocating for peace and justice throughout the Middle East.”\nThen on Monday, the three-term Democrat who represents Minnesota’s Fifth Congressional District engaged in a series of tweets describing the plight of residents in Gaza, which she said are victims of systematic apartheid, “and it must end.”\nShe also said that “targeting an entire civilian population will only sow more discord and perpetuate the cycle of violence.”\n“Palestinians have few recourses for justice and accountability,” Omar continued. “Attacks by the IDF and settlers against Palestinians are regularly met with impunity. Efforts to seek justice in international courts are stonewalled by the Israeli government, with U.S. support.”\nThose words were a stark contrast from those of her Democrat colleague Angie Craig.\n“The images we are seeing out of Israel are heart wrenching and the stories of women and children enduring unspeakable horrors are unforgivable,” Craig, a three-term Democrat from Apple Valley, said in a tweet on Saturday. “There are not two sides when radical Iranian-backed terrorists indiscriminately attack the civilians of America’s strongest ally.”\n",

        "article": "Dying to Live: Haiti’s COVID-19 Paradox\n\nOn March 19, 2020, a middle aged man entered a hospital in Haiti with a cough and difficulty breathing. The patient battled with steadily sinking oxygen levels and received medical attention for one hour before dying on the hospital bed. This dramatic and heartbreaking incident was the first known case of COVID-19 in Haiti, and the virus has continued to spread since then.\nHaiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. It experiences some of the world’s highest rates of death due to natural disasters, which have generated large-scale instability, poverty, and lack of shelter for many Haitians. These conditions have caused the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA) and other organizations to predict that the virus “could be devastating” in Haiti, and the world braced itself for the worst. But the worst has not come. At least not yet. While COVID-19 has been difficult to endure in Haiti, the high number of recoveries and lower than expected infection rates indicate that COVID-19 has not yet grown into the monstrous disaster in Haiti that many people thought it would. This surprising outcome could have been generated in part by the changes Haiti implemented in the aftermath of the disasters it has changed—the same disasters that analysts thought would make it easier for COVID-19 to devastate the island. Still, the relative success that Haiti has seen with the virus so far does not put them in the clear, and the country could face worse consequences once COVID-19 is over. Before these analyses can be made, however, it is critical to understand the battle Haiti has fought against this disease so far, particularly with regard to misinformation, economic instability, and healthcare resources.\n\nRumors and Misinformation\nAs of October 6, 2020 the World Health Organization reports 8,819 cases and 229 deaths in Haiti, with a flattening curve. Since the first case of COVID-19 within Haiti’s borders, there have been rumors circulating about the existence/real threat of the virus. Many residents question whether or not the virus is real, or at least its severity. Some Haitians think that COVID-19 is just a way for their government to secure more foreign aid money, which has come and gone without helping some of those who need it most. Even among those residents who do believe in the severity of COVID-19, there is distrust toward local hospitals. Residents think that experimental vaccines are being tested there without patient knowledge, as if bodies and lives were expendable. As a country with a strong oral tradition, communication between community members is a large part of how important information is spread. Both of these reasons have resulted in many people delaying a hospital visit and treatment until they are in a critical condition, because an earlier hospital visit would result in ostracization from their community. Contact tracing would require people to acknowledge that there is a problem, and the current lack of social distancing, masks, or other safety measures would make such tracing incredibly difficult even if it was implemented.\nDoctors Without Borders has made efforts to help address these problems. They have focused particularly on educating local community leaders about COVID-19 to help them discern between fact and fiction so they can spread that knowledge to those who trust them. But this process is slow, and even slower now that large community meetings can’t be held to answer questions and assuage fears. Only time will tell if these campaigns are able to make an impact.\nMisinformation can be detrimental to the evolution of the sanitary situation, but Haiti's problems with COVID-19 go beyond the rumors that are spread by word of mouth. As is the case in many other countries, the necessity to work and make a living for survival has hindered the possibility of social distancing, leading to an increase in transmission.\n\nThe Economic Issue\nMany Haitian households live day to day off the money they make, which is often US$2 per day or lower. In late April, John Carrol, MD, blogger for the Journal Star, wrote: “Haitians are angry that the informal street markets have been closed but that the large textile factories in Port au Prince and in northern Haiti were reopened this week.” The government has prioritized the profits of sweatshop owners and foreign businesses interests over the informal markets and businesses owned by their own citizens. These actions reflect the corrupt government priorities that have fueled mistrust amongst citizens, but also the lack of power citizens have to advocate for themselves and their working conditions while experiencing extreme poverty. These factories are also unlikely to provide working conditions that protect and prevent people from COVID-19 transmission, increasing spread amongst populations that can’t afford to make or buy masks. This means that part of the population isn’t allowed to work, increasing their risk for hunger and poverty, while another large part of the population has work, but the lack of protective measures makes them more vulnerable to transmission.\nTo add to Haiti’s struggle, the bordering Dominican Republic has had one of the worst resulting government responses to COVID-19. Because of the porous border these two countries share, controlling the virus in Haiti has become increasingly difficult. Since the start of the pandemic in March, about 24,000 Haitians who worked in the Dominican Republic have fled the area and returned to their homes in Haiti, creating a population influx into already densely packed streets.\nWhile quarantine and shutdown measures were taken soon after the first case appeared in Haiti, the economic conditions make a complete shutdown like those seen in other countries currently impossible. If Haiti were to take a turn for the worse, and Haitians were to stop working, the economy would be severely damaged. If they lost the ability to go to work, individuals would lack the resources they need for survival, which could quickly create large socio-economic divides between Haiti and the rest of the world.\n\nA Lack of Equipment\nFinally, lack of equipment in Haitian hospitals may contribute to the rise of COVID-19 on the island. The treatments and tests that doctors are able to give are limited. While there are 41 centers in Haiti that could utilize platforms like Cepheid to implement more testing, Haiti is not receiving tests from manufacturers. Wealth disparities impact many developing countries, as tests are going to the countries who can afford to pay more for them, mostly the US and Europe. In Haiti, protective equipment is lacking and hospitals are unable to set up effective isolation to ensure patient safety because of this. However, in spite of all these challenges, Haitian hospitals have weathered the COVID-19 storm better than predicted with a nearly 82 percent survival rate. In order to understand why Haitians appear to be staying relatively healthy, it is necessary to look less toward the events of recent months and more toward the consequences of Haiti’s tumultuous past.\n\nCurses Come with Blessings\nSeveral unintentional factors have helped Haiti naturally defend itself against this virus so far. One of the country’s most prominent doctors Marie Deschamps says that the “country has been very vulnerable” to a wide array of challenges, such as “political destabilization, impacts of deforestation on farmland and drinking water sources, hurricanes, and a never-ending procession of infectious diseases” to name a few. These disasters may have created some of the conditions most helpful to Haiti during this crisis, and it is important to analyze them in tandem with the community’s response to this sickness.\nWithin homes, social distancing is difficult, but many are well ventilated as a result of the climate and the many natural disasters that have impacted construction, which reduced the likelihood that infectious particles will infect others within the space. This is often a result of natural disasters, which have rendered better insulated homes uninhabitable, forcing families to relocate and find less traditional shelters. Haiti’s history with other disease outbreaks such as AIDS and cholera may also have contributed to early immune responses in the body to defend against COVID-19. Additionally, a youth group leader who works toward defeating misinformation in Haitian slums explains that “[Haitians] know there are many people who have ailments such as fever, flu. They stay at home, taking care of themselves with traditional medicine.” In this respect, it is a mixed blessing that people are waiting until it is critical to come to the hospital. While a perfect world would allow everyone experiencing symptoms to receive the treatment they need, if everyone went to the hospital immediately in the current context, the system would be quickly overwhelmed and unable to provide effective care. These factors, among others, have helped Haiti keep COVID-19 at bay, although they cannot keep the virus away forever.\n\nLong Term Implications\nAs well as Haiti is handling the virus now, there will be impacts that affect its population for a long time to come. Sandra Lamarque, head of Haiti’s Doctors Without Borders mission, reports that vaccinations for babies and children have dropped significantly, along with an even sharper decline in the number of women choosing to go to public hospitals to give birth.\nWhile it can be celebrated that COVID-19 has not taken as large a toll on Haiti as analysts originally thought it would, it is still necessary to be critical about how these results are interpreted and how these interpretations will influence decision-making in Haiti going forward. For starters, the number of cases and deaths up to this point is not certain, as testing has been scarce and many cases and deaths have gone uncounted. The natural guards Haiti has been able to take advantage of in its fight against COVID-19 will not be effective in the long term. After this international crisis is over, there will still be damages to reckon with and many who have suffered in every country, especially those countries who were already suffering before the pandemic.",

        "article": "Here's how conservatives have prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nIt didn’t have to be this way.\n\nNearly two full years after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, Americans’ lives are still being dictated by the virus.\nHundreds are still dying every day, largely the unvaccinated, whose refusal to take a life-saving medicine has turned herd immunity into a faraway fantasy.\nBut it didn’t have to be this way.\nMore lives could have been saved. Interruptions that have come to mark daily life in the 2020s could have been mitigated.\nAt every turn, conservatives — from President Donald Trump on down to local lawmakers — undermined the seriousness of the virus, politicized public health measures, and worked tirelessly to subvert guidelines that would have kept people out of hospitals.\nBelow is a running tally of the myriad ways in which Republicans have prolonged this seemingly unending pandemic, now in its third year and still overwhelming hospitals.\n\nCongress\nWithin two months of taking office, President Joe Biden managed to corral support for a historic $1.9 billion stimulus package that sent $1,400 direct-mail checks to every American, supported struggling small businesses, lowered health insurance premiums, extended unemployment benefits, and expanded tax credits designed to lift children out of poverty.\nRepublicans were united in their opposition to the American Rescue Plan.\nBut beyond their legislative intransigence, GOP senators and representatives promoted coronavirus misinformation at every turn, turning apolitical scientific facts into culture war topics.\nMembers have touted unproven drugs to their constituents, questioned the effectiveness of vaccines, and made ahistorical comparisons between public health measures and the Holocaust.\nRepublicans have also repeatedly antagonized public health leaders.\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has used congressional hearings to lob falsehoods at Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Paul has accused him of being part of a team that created the virus in a Chinese laboratory.\n\nGovernors\nGovernors have served as the lead architects of their states’ COVID-19 responses. But in GOP-led states, governors have forcefully fought back against common-sense public health requirements.\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis ruled by executive order that only parents can decide whether their children wear masks in school in defiance of CDC recommendations. Virginia’s newly seated governor, Glenn Youngkin, followed suit last weekend.\nIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott banned private companies from mandating their employees receive the vaccine to work.\nLast summer, GOP governors also mobilized to cut off $300-a-week unemployment assistance for their residents to encourage people to get back to work, even though experts warned the move would reduce income and consumer spending while hurting workers of color.\nMonths later, DeSantis and state lawmakers in multiple other states did propose expanding unemployment benefits, but just for residents who were fired for refusing the vaccine.\nGovernors including DeSantis, Abbott, and Missouri’s Mike Parson have also pushed alternative treatments for their residents, such as expensive antibody treatments, in lieu of masking and vaccines.\nAnd they’ve flouted public health guidelines themselves, setting an example for unvaccinated residents to go out in public unmasked and spread the virus.\nIn South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem trumpeted her state’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in 2021, making a dramatic entrance on horseback and waving an American flag, despite public health experts’ warnings that an event drawing half a million people could be dangerous amid the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.\nFollowing the event, COVID-19 cases spiked in the area.\n\nState and local lawmakers\nAcross the country, conservative state and local elected officials have banded together to strip Democratic and Republican governors of their emergency COVID-19 powers over issues like spending of federal relief money or plans to reopen the economy.\nState lawmakers have worked to curtail public health measures and ban vaccine and mask mandates. They’ve also invited vaccine skeptics and conspiracy theorists to state capitols, and have questioned vaccine effectiveness before an audience of vulnerable constituents.\nGOP Pennsylvania state Rep. Stephanie Borowicz argued the pandemic may be “punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins” and introduced a resolution in March 2020 calling for “A State Day of Humiliation, Fasting, and Prayer.”\nIdaho state Rep. Heather Scott declared, “The pandemic is over” at the start of the 2021 legislative session, and later accused the National Governors Association of being run by “globalists” after the organization released a statement with tips about virus misinformation.\n\nSheriffs\nA new movement has sprouted up among the nation’s law enforcement officers that has resulted in more anti-public health fervor across the country.\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, a right-wing anti-government group, claims membership of hundreds of sheriffs nationwide. These officers assert the power to interpret laws however they see fit, answering only to voters and not to state or federal authorities.\nAs a result, sheriffs have been meeting public health guidelines delivered from governors with staunch opposition and a refusal to enforce the rules.\nOfficers have also faced lawsuits for their treatment of people in prison throughout the pandemic.\nThe ACLU filed a lawsuit against a sheriff in Arkansas after a prison doctor treated COVID-positive patients with the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, which research shows can cause serious harm and has not been approved for COVID-19 treatment.\nSheriffs have also been sued in California and Colorado for failing to enforce proper social distancing for people in jails, report positive cases, or administer testing.\n\nRight-wing media\nThe right-wing media, including outlets like Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News Network, have broadcast misinformation about the pandemic that’s having a strong effect on their viewers and further politicizing what began as apolitical public health guidance.\nThe misinformation began in March 2020, when Fox News first started downplaying the virus’s threat. On March 9, Fox host Sean Hannity said the virus was being used to “bludgeon Trump with this new hoax.”\nWith each new development, Fox News was there, villainizing public health leaders and their suggestions. Conservative pundits mocked masks and minimized the virus’s threat throughout the fall of 2020.\nSince COVID-19 vaccines became widely available for Americans, these outlets have continued to caution Americans against getting inoculated, despite the fact that the vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in fighting the virus in countless clinical studies.\nPolling has demonstrated just how widespread the right-wing media’s disinformation campaign has been on the American electorate.\nA December 2020 analysis conducted by three political scientists at U.S. universities found nearly that right-wing media had published almost 4,000 stories with COVID-19 misinformation between Feb. 1 and March 23, 2020.\nAnd almost 80% of Americans believe or are unsure about pandemic-related misinformation, according to a November Kaiser Family Foundation survey. Those who believed in COVID-19 conspiracy theories also noted their trust in the right-wing outlets that have promulgated them throughout the last two years.\nThe survey found that numerous respondents believed the government to be exaggerating the number of COVID-19 deaths in addition to a slate of other vaccine mistruths: that it alters your DNA, can infect you with the virus, or contains a microchip.\n\nDonald Trump\nOf course, the progenitor of COVID-19 misinformation and pandemic mismanagement is the de facto leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump.\nHe frequently undermined his own public health advisers, promoted falsehoods about the virus, interfered with public health agencies, violated guidelines, and failed to take seriously a life-threatening pandemic in its early days.\nResearchers at Cornell University found that Trump’s statements questioning masks, boosting unscientific treatments, and accusing the Food and Drug Administration of being part of the “deep state” and misrepresenting testing results to be the most widespread source of pandemic misinformation at the start of the pandemic in 2020.\nThat. year, Trump insisted a vaccine was coming much sooner than scientists predicted, before the November election; blamed the media for reporting supposedly inaccurate testing totals; labeled unproven treatments as cures; and promised the virus was “going away” and that he had ended the pandemic when it was in fact still raging.\nHe also sought to interfere with public health leaders who were trying to get the pandemic under control.\nTrump; Dr. Scott Atlas, Trump’s pandemic adviser with no public health experience; and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, worked to sideline the CDC, according to emails and transcripts unveiled by a House committee investigating the administration’s pandemic mishandling.\nTrump withdrew the United States from the World Health Organization, cutting off crucial funding to the global health agency after it failed to meet his demands for promoting travel restrictions and investigating China’s role in the pandemic.\nHe also personally contradicted his own public health advisers. Trump would frequently criticize Fauci, who was the nation’s primary public health messenger at the time, and lambaste him over his recommendations to social distance and wear masks.\nTrump set a poor example for Americans by frequently violating CDC guidelines, hosting numerous rallies with unmasked attendees, meeting with advisers and guests in close proximity with no masks, and holding a Rose Garden ceremony and indoor reception for then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Amy Coney Barrett. Trump and other attendees later tested positive for COVID-19.\nFormer White House COVID-19 response coordinator Deborah Birx told the House last October that Trump very well could have saved more than 130,000 lives if he had taken heed of guidance from his public health advisers.\nA UCLA researcher set the number of casualties of Trump’s mismanagement much higher, estimating 400,000 lives could have been saved if Trump had implemented widespread testing and mask mandates.\nWith 850,000 total dead from COVID-19 in America, that means if Trump had chosen to listen to the science instead of demeaning it, he could have halved the death toll of America’s deadliest pandemic.\nInstead, with the help of conservative allies intent on demonizing public health figures and amplifying conspiracy theories, the toll continues to rise, as Americans wonder whether an end to this pandemic will ever be in sight.",

        "article": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Responds To Trump Charges By Calling COVID-19 A Biological Weapon\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) is continuing her defense of former President Donald Trump, even after his third criminal case emerged this week that this time relates to attempts by him and his allies after the last presidential election to secure him another four years despite his documented loss to Joe Biden.\nOn Wednesday morning, she posted a lengthy statement to Twitter complaining about the new charges Trump is facing, which include allegations of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the course of her commentary, she touched on what she called “bird killing wind turbines” and referred to COVID-19 as a “man made biological weapon,” which is not the consensus view from established authorities, though some have explored the possibility of a lab leak — which experts have noted would not necessarily mean the spread of the virus was intentional.\nGreene’s overall argument was that Americans are facing much more serious issues than those ostensibly represented by the case newly brought against Trump by Special Counsel Jack Smith at the federal Justice Department. A key component of arguments she and others ideologically aligned with her have pushed to further this idea is the contention that the southern border is “open,” which isn’t reflected in the facts. Government personnel directly involved in the handling of the border have disputed this characterization, though proposed articles of impeachment against Biden from Rep.

        "article": "How Lawmakers in Texas and Florida Undermine Covid Vaccination Efforts\n\nKatherine Wells wants to urge her Lubbock, Texas, community to get vaccinated against covid-19. “That could really save people from severe illness,” said Wells, the city’s public health director.\nBut she can’t.\nA rule added to Texas’ budget that went into effect Sept. 1 forbids health departments and other organizations funded by the state government to advertise, recommend, or even list covid vaccines alone. “Clinics may inform patients that COVID-19 vaccinations are available,” the rule allows, “if it is not being singled out from other vaccines.”\nTexas isn’t the only state curtailing the public conversation about covid vaccines. Tennessee’s health department homepage, for example, features the flu, vaping, and cancer screening but leaves out covid and covid vaccines. Florida is an extreme case, where the health department has issued guidance against covid vaccines that runs counter to scientific studies and advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNotably, the shift in health information trails rhetoric from primarily Republican politicians who have reversed their positions on covid vaccines. Fierce opposition to measures like masking and business closures early in the pandemic fueled a mistrust of the CDC and other scientific institutions and often falls along party lines: Last month, a KFF poll found that 84% of Democrats said they were confident in the safety of covid vaccines, compared with 36% of Republicans. It’s a dramatic drop from 2021, when two-thirds of Republicans were vaccinated.\nAs new vaccines roll out ahead of the expected winter surge of covid, some health officials are treading carefully to avoid blowback from the public and policymakers. So far, vaccine uptake is low, with less than 5% of Americans receiving an updated shot, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Wells fears the consequences will be dire: “We will see a huge disparity in health outcomes because of changes in language.”\nA study published in July found that Republicans and Democrats in Ohio and Florida died at roughly similar rates before covid vaccines emerged, but a disparity between parties grew once the first vaccines were widely available in 2021 and uptake diverged. By year’s end, Republicans had a 43% higher rate of excess deaths than Democrats.\nPublic health initiatives have long been divisive — water fluoridation, needle exchanges, and universal health care, to name a few. But the pandemic turned up the volume to painful levels, public health officials say. More than 500 left their jobs under duress in 2020 and 2021, and legislators in at least 26 states passed laws to prevent public officials from setting health policies. Republican Arkansas state Sen. Trent Garner told KFF Health News in 2021, “It’s time to take the power away from the so-called experts.”\nAt first, vaccine mandates were contentious but the shots themselves were not. Scott Rivkees, Florida’s former surgeon general, now at Brown University, traces the shift to the months after Joe Biden was elected president. Though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis initially promoted covid vaccination, his stance changed as resistance to covid measures became central to his presidential campaign. In late 2021, he appointed Joseph Ladapo surgeon general. By then, Ladapo had penned Wall Street Journal op-eds skeptical of mainstream medical advice, such as one asking, “Are Covid Vaccines Riskier Than Advertised?”\nAs bivalent boosters rolled out last year, the Florida health department’s homepage removed information on covid vaccines. In its place were rules against mandates and details on how to obtain vaccine exemptions. Then, early this year, the department advised against vaccinating children and teens.\nThe state’s advice changed once more when the CDC recommended updated covid vaccines in September. DeSantis incorrectly said the vaccines had “not been proven to be safe or effective.” And the health department amended its guidance to say men under age 40 should not be vaccinated because the department had conducted research and deemed the risk of heart complications like myocarditis unacceptable. It refers to a short, authorless document posted online rather than in a scientific journal where it would have been vetted for accuracy. The report uses an unusual method to analyze health records of vaccinated Floridians. Citing serious flaws, most other researchers call it misinformation.\nScientifically vetted studies, and the CDC’s own review, contradict Florida’s conclusion against vaccination. Cases of myocarditis following mRNA vaccines have occurred but are much less frequent than cases triggered by covid. The risk is sevenfold higher from the disease than from mRNA vaccines, according to an analysis published in a medical journal based on a review of 22 other studies.\nSince leaving his post, Rivkees has been stunned to see the state health department subsumed by political meddling.\nAbout 28,700 children and adults from birth to age 39 have died of covid in the United States. Florida’s anti-vaccine messaging affects people of all ages, Rivkees added, not just those who are younger.\nHe points out that Florida performed well compared with other states in 2020 and 2021, ranking 38th in covid deaths per capita despite a large population of older adults. Now it has the sixth-highest rate of covid deaths in the country.\n“There is no question that the rise of misinformation and the politicization of the response has taken a toll on public health,” he said.\nAs in Florida, the Texas health department initially promoted covid vaccines, warning that Texans who weren’t vaccinated were about 20 times as likely to suffer a covid-associated death. Such sentiments faded last year, as state leaders passed policies to block vaccine mandates and other public health measures. The latest is a prohibition against the use of government funds to promote covid vaccines. Uptake in Texas is already low, with fewer than 4% of residents getting the bivalent booster that rolled out last year.\nAt Lubbock’s health department, Wells managed to put out a press release saying the city offers covid vaccines but stopped short of recommending them. “We aren’t able to do as big a push as other states,” she said.\nSome health officials are altering their recommendations, given the current climate. Janet Hamilton, executive director at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said clear-cut advice to get vaccinated against covid works when people trust the scientific establishment, but it risks driving others away from all vaccines. “It’s important for public health to meet people where they are,” Hamilton said.\nMissouri’s health department took this tack on X, formerly known as Twitter: “COVID vaccines will be available in Missouri soon, if you’re in to that sort of thing. If not, just keep scrolling!”",

        "article": "Gaza declares COVID-19 disaster with health system near collapse\n\nWith a lack of ventilators, PPE, and medicine, officials say Israel’s siege is a ‘death sentence’ for Gaza’s coronavirus patients.\n\nA rapid rise in coronavirus infections in the Gaza Strip has reached a “catastrophic stage”, with the blockaded Palestinian enclave’s medical system likely to collapse soon, health officials warn.\nCOVID is spreading exponentially in Gaza – one of the most crowded places on Earth – especially in refugee camps, and the health ministry has warned of “disastrous” implications.\nDr Fathi Abuwarda, adviser to the minister of health, told Al Jazeera the recent spike in infections could soon become uncontrollable, with hundreds of people contracting the virus each day and nowhere to treat them.\n“We have entered the catastrophe stage and if we continue like this, the healthcare system will collapse,” Abuwarda said. “The best solution is a full lockdown for 14 days, which will allow medical teams to control and combat the virus, with only shops that provide food supplies kept open.”\nAbuwarda said the health ministry had prepared Gaza’s European Hospital to treat COVID-19 patients, but the hospital’s capacity was insufficient, with 300 of its 360 beds already occupied.\n“In the Gaza Strip, there are about 500 [hospital] beds scattered across the coastal enclave…. But considering some 5,000 Palestinians live in each square kilometre in Gaza, these hospitals can’t accommodate all cases,” he said.\nA lack of coronavirus testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) is also complicating the fight, as Israel continues to impose restrictions on medical supplies reaching Gaza.\nGaza has been under a tight land, air and sea siege for more than 13 years by Israel and Egypt, cutting it off from the rest of the world. Early hopes that Gaza’s isolation would spare it from the pandemic were dashed as the densely populated coastal region came under severe threat with a dilapidated healthcare system that is unable to handle the onslaught of patients.\nOn August 24, only four Palestinians were reported to have been infected with the virus in the Gaza Strip. As of Monday, 14,768 people had contracted COVID-19, with 65 deaths. The number of critical cases stands at 79.\n\n‘Imminent catastrophe’\nOfficials say Israel’s siege is a death sentence for Gaza’s COVID-19 patients.\n“The Gaza Strip lacks oxygen-generating machines, ventilators, protective gear, and hygiene materials,” said Dr Basim Naim, head of international relations in the Hamas-led government.\n“Thirty-two percent of basic drugs and 62 percent of drugs and materials for medical laboratories are not available.”\nThe former minister of health called on the international community and aid agencies to immediately intervene to stop the “imminent catastrophe”, accusing Israel of restricting the entry of medical supplies under “the pretext of security”.\n“Hamas’ leadership will not accept the death of the Palestinian people either by starving or by leaving them to die by the pandemic,” said Naim. “We call on the international community to provide us with the financial resources needed to purchase all necessary items to combat the virus.”\nSalama Marouf, head of the government’s information office, underscored the need to bring life-saving ventilators into Gaza. He added that “all measures are on the table now, including a full lockdown” to get infections under control.\nOfficials say despite Egyptian mediation, Israeli still refuses to allow ventilators into Gaza, making granting that permission conditional upon the return of soldiers’ bodies kept by Hamas since the 2014 Israeli war on Gaza.\nThe Gaza Strip – a 100km-long (45-mile) coastal area home to more than 2.1 million Palestinians – was one of the last regions to be hit by COVID-19 worldwide.\nBut many people here ignored advice to wear masks, held large wedding parties and protests against Israel’s occupation, and continue to socialise at mass gatherings.\nAbuwarda highlighted the “lack of commitment” among Palestinians when it comes to wearing masks, social distancing, and practising proper hygiene. “We must count on people’s awareness to stop the spread of the virus,” he said.\n\nDrastic measures\nThe influx of coronavirus patients into regular hospitals also threatens those with other illnesses.\n“These hospitals are not fully prepared to deal with COVID-19 patients and will negatively impact the medical service provided to normal patients,” said Naim.\nMany Palestinians were in favour of the government taking drastic measures to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus.\nBut some officials say they cannot impose a general lockdown as people’s minimum essential needs would go unmet because of the deteriorated state of the economy.\nAhmad Abu Mustapha, 35, an electrical equipment shop owner, called on the government to apply a full lockdown to “help save lives” even if it inflicts economic pain.\n“We fear for ourselves, our families and children. We want a full lockdown even if this harms us economically,” said Mustapha.\nJournalist Hassan Islayih, 32, agreed on the need to shut down movement in the Gaza Strip, noting “people’s awareness is not as it should be”.\n“Today the situation is dangerous. Some people will lose their jobs, which is sad, but there is no other solution than a full lockdown,” he said.",

        "article": "The fallout of the military’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate\n\nThe new year brought a major victory for thousands of service members who refused the COVID-19 vaccines – and the conservative lawmakers and pundits who backed them. The Pentagon was forced to repeal its coronavirus mandate by a largely-GOP-backed requirement added to the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in December. But many troops who balked at taking the shots still face uncertain futures.\nThe controversy shows how healthcare became a political football, with both the far right and some on the left objecting to mandated COVID vaccinations, mask-wearing, and other government public health responses. It also revealed how COVID disinformation spread and caught fire, stoking deepening mistrust of government among wide segments of American society.\nMore than 17,000 service members balked at taking the shots, citing safety fears linked to the vaccine’s speedy development and spurred by misinformation about messenger ribonucleic acid technology, as well as concern over fetal cell lines used in formulation and testing. The more the controversy raged in the news, the more troops asked to skip the shots, Military Times reporting found.\nWhile the Pentagon lifted the vaccine mandate as ordered, officials warned that repealing it would affect military readiness, potentially putting service members at risk of serious illness. DoD officials believe the shots worked: Not a single service member has died of COVID-19 since early 2022, when more than 98% of the active duty force had been at least partially vaccinated.\n“The Department will continue to promote and encourage COVID-19 vaccination for all Service members,” Austin wrote in the Jan. 10 memo repealing the mandate. “The Department has made COVID-19 vaccination as easy and convenient as possible, resulting in vaccines administered to over two million Service members and 96 percent of the force ― Active and Reserve ― being fully vaccinated.”\nThe now-lifted mandate’s aftermath is still playing out. Of the 17,000 service members who refused to take the vaccine, roughly half have been discharged and another thousand or so secured exemptions.\nSeparated troops are eligible to upgrade their discharges, or even come back into service if they want to. At the same time, Pentagon officials are still determining how to treat ― and possibly reprimand ― the remaining 7,000 troops who leaders say did not follow a lawful order.\nThe mandate’s end put a halt to any adverse actions against currently serving troops who had applied for exemptions, while opening the door for those involuntarily separated to apply to have their characterizations of service changed on their discharge paperwork. What it didn’t do was authorize them to automatically get their jobs back, or furnish any back pay for the time between their discharges and the mandate repeal, though some Republican lawmakers are still pushing for that legislation.\nThe Pentagon is also exploring how to handle a small number of still-serving troops who didn’t apply for waivers, but avoided dismissal during the vaccine mandate, meaning they refused a lawful order to get vaccinated.\n“It’s very important that our service members follow orders when they are lawful, and there are thousands that did not,” Gil Cisneros, the Pentagon’s personnel boss, told members of the House Armed Services Committee in February. “The services are going through a process to review those cases to make a determination what needs to be done.”\nIn addition to separating more than 8,000 troops, the services granted roughly 1,200 permanent and temporary exemptions for the vaccine, whether for administrative reasons, including religious objection, or medical concerns.\nThe number of waivers was unprecedented. In August 2021, before the Pentagon first announced its forthcoming mandate, vaccine exemptions were relatively rare, and mostly given for past allergic reactions or for temporary situations, like pregnancy or an impending separation from service.\nInvoluntary discharges for separation were even more rare, and hadn’t happened in any significant way since the early 2000s, when the widespread side effects of the anthrax vaccine prompted a groundswell of troops to refuse it.\n\nBy the numbers\nFrom late 2021 to early 2023, the military services discharged roughly 8,300 troops from the active and reserve components, most of whom received general discharges and were welcome to serve in uniform again if they got vaccinated.\nThe Air Force Department discharged a total of 834 personnel in 2022, before a July court order halted any further separations for those whose waivers had been rejected, according to data provided to Military Times.\nAs of Jan. 10, when the mandate repeal came down, the Air Force had more than 3,100 religious accommodation requests pending, with another 30 appeals waiting for department approval.\nOverall, the Air Force approved 389 religious, administrative and medical exemptions for active duty troops.\nThe Army discharged 1,881 soldiers before Jan. 10, according to service data, while granting 191 exemptions out of 10,699 requests.\nIn the end, the Navy granted 168 medical exemptions, 153 of them temporary, as well as 50 religious accommodations. Data as of Jan. 9, the day before the mandate repeal, show 1,878 sailors were discharged.\nIn general, temporary medical exemptions can include while a service member is pregnant or breastfeeding, for example, or undergoing a medical issue or treatment that might negatively react with a vaccine.\nThe Marine Corps tracks its data differently from the other services, spokesman Capt. Ryan Bruce told Military Times. The total number of waiver applications was not available, he said, but as of Jan. 5, the Corps had approved 420 administrative or medical exemptions to COVID-19 vaccination.\nThe most recent number for religious accommodations was 23, as of Nov. 23, he added.\nIn total, the service involuntarily separated 3,746 Marines before the mandate’s repeal.\n\nControversy stokes vaccine hesitancy\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent development of a vaccine presented a unique situation for the military, an institution known for requiring a battery of inoculations, all of which can be given during initial medical workups as soon as recruits ship to training.\nBefore COVID, the anthrax vaccine had caused much controversy in the early 2000s, resulting in involuntary discharges for refusals and pushing DoD to rethink how it decides to make a vaccine mandatory.\nIn that spirit, the Pentagon rolled out its COVID-19 vaccination program on a voluntary basis in December 2020, delaying making it mandatory until the Food and Drug Administration granted fully licensed the Pfizer version of the vaccine in August 2021.\nBut by that point, COVID-19 vaccination had opened a fierce partisan divide, with many conservative politicos and influencers railing against it.\nSoon after each of the military services published their mandatory vaccination policies, lawsuits sprang up, from troops accusing the services of wrongfully denying religious accommodation requests, or arguing that applying for one was futile because messaging from the chain of command made it clear they wouldn’t be approved.\nPost-mandate, the numbers suggest that the vaccine awareness brought on by the fierce ideological debate over the COVID-19 vaccine might have increased overall anti-vaccine sentiment across the services.\nIn the Air Force, overall vaccine exemptions went up during the 18 months between the COVID-19 vaccine mandate’s announcement and repeal. In August 2021, the Air Force reported 336 total administrative vaccine waivers on file. As of Jan. 3, according to service data, that number has more than doubled: 12 in the active component, 742 in the Air National Guard and 62 in the Air Force Reserve.\nBecause each of the services has taken a different tack when tracking vaccine waiver requests and exemptions, it’s difficult to make apples-to-apples comparisons to the numbers before the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.\nIn August 2021, the Army reported 106 overall administrative exemptions, which included religious exemptions, as well as temporary waivers for soldiers on temporary duty, in the middle of a permanent change-of-station move or preparing to leave service in the next 6 months.\nPost-mandate, now tracking religious waivers specifically, the Army is currently assessing five applications for other vaccines, none of them so far approved.\nThe Navy and Marine Corps reported in summer 2021 that they did not have any current religious accommodations, and hadn’t granted one in nearly a decade.\nCurrently, according to Navy data, there are no pending religious waivers for vaccines other than COVID. In the Marine Corps, Bruce said, no other religious waivers have been granted in the past two and a half years.\nAnd, Navy spokeswoman Gloria Kwizera told Military Times, the service doesn’t have a process for requesting a permanent medical waiver for other vaccines.\n“Navy Medicine does not track the number of Navy service members who request permanent medical exemption from a non-COVID-19 vaccine from their provider,” she said.\nThe Navy’s Bureau of Medicine and Surgery is also responsible for the Marine Corps.\nEach of the military departments is responsible for governing its own vaccine exemption process, so it’s difficult to compare numbers of each type of waiver across the services.\n\nWhy they said “no”\nWhile anti-vaccine sentiment has grown in the U.S. in recent years, reflected in localized outbreaks of polio and measles, Americans declined the COVID-19 vaccine at much higher rates than any other inoculation, members of the military included.\nHistorically, the kind of alternative beliefs, like anti-vaccine Jehovah’s Witnesses, that fostered opposition to vaccination were rarely found in the same demographics of people who were interested in military service, Katherine Kuzminski, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Military Times on Feb. 8.\nBut as some right-wing factions take up the anti-vaccine cause, there is a question of whether they’ll bleed into more mainstream conservative values, and whether that will in turn affect a historically conservative-leaning military population.\n“People who’ve been vaccine-aware have fallen, really, on the extreme,” she said.\nEmails from Military Times readers overwhelmingly make the distinction between the COVID-19 vaccine and previous inoculations that have been around longer and had longer testing periods before FDA approval.\nBut the services don’t have a waiver category for “I’m just not sure the science is there,” so most exemption requests defaulted to religious reasons.\nAnother major point of contention for readers was that the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines were either made with or tested on human stem cells descended from fetal tissue, which is commonly procured after abortion procedures. But Catholic leaders have long said the “sin” is too far removed from the vaccine itself to violate any religious beliefs.\n“The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were tested using an abortion-derived cell line,” Archbishop for the military services Timothy P. Broglio said in an October 2021 statement, explaining that simply testing with those cells is not sinful, whereas he states that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine “was developed, tested, and is produced, with abortion-derived cell lines”, which makes it more problematic.\n“If it were the only vaccine available, it would be morally permissible, but the faithful Catholic is to make known his or her preference for a more morally acceptable treatment,” the archbishop said.\nBut there are other mandatory vaccines that use these same fetal-tissue-derived cell lines in their development, including chickenpox and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), all of which most troops are required to take as part of basic training if they don’t have their vaccine record handy upon enlistment.\n“I did see several soldiers who claimed ‘religious exemptions’ to the COVID-19 vaccines due to the fetal cell lines used in research,” wrote one reader, an Army sergeant and medic stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas.\n“Most of these soldiers had no problem taking the MMR vaccine (which also uses fetal cell lines) in basic training so I found their newfound religion unconvincing, especially since I never saw them at chapel,” he told Military Times in an email, requesting anonymity out of concern for career repercussions.\nAsked whether new vaccine awareness had prompted existing troops to seek waivers for vaccines other than COVID-19, only one Military Times reader said he had considered it.\n“I do have strong religious beliefs that I think are consistent, demonstrable and should qualify. To be honest I feel the burden of having gone against them to save my career,” an Air Force captain stationed at Joint Base San Antonio told Military Times, who also requested anonymity out of concern for career repercussions.\nGiven the choice, the captain said he wouldn’t get the annual flu vaccine for personal reasons, but he did not specify which vaccines he would consider a waiver for and why.\n“Part of the problem is that these requests, like conscientious objector requests, do not permit a gradation of understanding,” he said. So, to try to qualify under the exemption terms, troops often cited strongly held beliefs that stemmed from a personal creed but weren’t demonstrably supported by any religious tradition or guidance from religious leaders.\n“Those who are opposing the vaccine didn’t do themselves any favors by trying to frame it in religious freedom language, when it actually was [that] there may have been some who were opposed to the the process by which the vaccines were developed, or they were opposed to the political process that developed the vaccine at the speed that it did,” Kuzminksi said. “There isn’t a clear avenue for them to register that complaint.”\nThis lines up with the many lawsuits filed against DoD by service members who opposed the vaccine, including those who sought religious exemptions.\nWhile some based their arguments on opposition to abortion, there were many complainants who cited more ambiguous beliefs, including concerns about the messenger ribonucleic acid technology in the Pfizer and Moderna products, or about what they put in their bodies in general.\n“Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and that they are to glorify God with their bodies lays the foundation for everything they do, consume, or inject into their bodies,” read one lawsuit, Navy SEAL 1-26 vs. Biden , filed in Florida. “From this foundation, they make studied and reasonable decisions about what is good and what is not good or may not be good for their bodies.”\nMilitary leaders hoped they’d solved the objection problem when the Pentagon approved the use of alternative vaccine Novavax. But DoD data shows just 5,000 troops completed their vaccine series in the three months following Novavax emergency use authorization. For comparison, more than 300,000 troops were vaccinated in the three months prior to Novavax’s release.\n\nCulture Clash\nIn the end, troop objections may have risen because of the Pentagon’s about face in vaccine policy, Kuzminksi said. Because the COVID-19 vaccine was voluntary for the first nine months of its availability, service members had the rare option to make an independent medical decision. The mandate took that choice away.\nThe result – that a small but vocal minority of troops and their allies on Capitol Hill were able to extinguish the Pentagon’s vaccine mandate – is sure to trigger similar attacks on other controversial public health or social policies.\nMembers of Congress have already targeted diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as well as Pentagon efforts to combat violent extremist activity and sentiment. A Senate Armed Services Committee report from July argued that “spending additional time and resources to combat exceptionally rare instances of extremism in the military is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds,” and should be discontinued immediately.\nIt’s a political counteroffensive that started, or picked up momentum, in the early days of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s tenure, when he ordered an anti-extremism stand-down and directed the department to beef up its screening, education and research efforts to both prevent extremism in the ranks and get a better idea of its prevalence.\nIn recent weeks, the move to equalize access to reproductive health care has also sparked the ire of Republicans in Congress.\nFollowing an announcement that DoD would cover travel costs for troops who have to travel out of state for a self-paid abortion, a group of senators sent a letter to the Pentagon demanding information on other procedures covered under that kind of policy, as well as whether anti-abortion commanders will be reprimanded if they attempt to deny leave under the new policy.\nCongress is well within its powers to pass legislation hemming in Pentagon policy, but partisan squabbles have the potential to keep undermining the very definition of a lawful order, by empowering individual troops to push back against them based on personal belief, according to Kuzminski.\n“That’s part of your oath, right? When you join, you’re setting aside your individual preferences or concerns in order to follow a lawful order,” she said. But with the COVID-19 mandate, “individuals who push back on a lawful order fundamentally saw that it worked.”",

People have had to deal with a huge amount of suffering.”\nBrazil is now seeing uncomfortable reminders of the pandemic’s worst days.\nIn the Amazon rainforest city of Manaus, the health system is again being pushed to the brink, echoing haunting scenes last April of mass graves and corpses piled in refrigerator trucks.\nAs the authorities deployed refrigerator trucks a second time, a court on Saturday ordered the state government to shut non-essential businesses for 15 days.\nCalifornia has also deployed 166 refrigerated trailers to be used as temporary morgues by overwhelmed hospitals, officials said.\n\nFar-ranging fallout\nThe pandemic crushed economic growth last year, and France’s finance minister warned that the worst was still to come.\n“There will be more bankruptcies in 2021 than in 2020,” said Bruno Le Maire.\nThe minister in charge of Japan’s pandemic response, meanwhile, warned that Tokyo’s medical system was “stretched thin,” a major worry for a city gearing up to host the Olympic Games in the summer.\nThe Australian city of Brisbane called a snap three-day lockdown after a worker at a quarantine hotel contracted the highly infectious British strain of Covid-19.\nIn China, authorities have moved swiftly to contain a new cluster of cases in Shijiazhuang, in northern Hebei province, closing schools, cutting travel links and implementing mass testing.\nEngland, meanwhile, announced it would introduce mandatory coronavirus testing for all international arrivals starting early next week.\n\nUK strain hits France\nFrance said it had confirmed 10 cases of the mutant British coronavirus strain – a worrying development which means the more infectious strain could already be circulating more widely in the country.\nRestrictions at the British border – blocking most people from entering France, including tourists – will nonetheless be kept in force “until further notice” in a bid to stop the new strain taking hold, said Prime Minister Jean Castex.\n\n‘Catastrophic’ impact\nBritain began its third lockdown on Wednesday despite being praised for a relatively rapid vaccine rollout.\n“Unless we take the lockdown seriously the impact on healthcare for the whole country could be catastrophic,” said Rupert Pearse, a professor of intensive care medicine who works at the Royal London Hospital.\nThe surge in British cases has not left elite sport untouched, with Aston Villa becoming the fourth Premier League football club to confirm an outbreak.\nThose infections add to growing worries about whether English football’s top-flight can complete the season on schedule, with 40 players across the league testing positive last week and three matches already postponed.",

        "article": "Indifference To COVID Is Indifference To The Value Of Life\n\nLife is a precious gift to be honored and preserved. This does not mean we should artificially preserve life indefinitely, hooked up on a machine, never allowing a person to go to their natural death. When we do that, what they have is not true life, but its shadow, and with it, the person has lost most if not all the dignity which should be associated with life in the process. On the other hand, we should not be indifferent to the plight of others. We should do what we can to protect and preserve the life of others, but we must do so in a way which does not undermine the value of life itself. This is why health care should be seen as a right. Needless to say, so many of those who claim to support life, so many who claim all life is precious, show through their actions how little they believe their own words. While they speak loudly about matters which do not concern them or place any expectations or burdens upon themselves, when they are expected to do something, they often make the loudest noise against doing what is necessary. Even if it is minor action expected of them, they will find every excuse they can to dismiss their obligation, proving that their words about life are meaningless. Indeed, they, like Cain, end up asking, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (Gen. 4:9b RSV). We have seen this with COVID, where so many not only fought against actions which were necessary to limit its spread and harm to society, they continue that fight to this day. They show a grave indifference to life when natural threats come toward them, an indifference which, as St. John Paul II knew, only makes things worse: “Some threats come from nature itself, but they are made worse by the culpable indifference and negligence of those who could in some cases remedy them.”[Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nCOVID, as it continues to evolve and comes to us in new forms, remains a threat which we should not take likely. While we have a better handle on how to deal with it, and we are better protected against it if we are vaccinated, this does not mean we are entirely in the clear. Vaccinated people can still die from COVID. Vaccinated people can still have long-term effects due to COVID. Vaccinated people can still spread COVID to others. Obviously, vaccinated people have these issues less than unvaccinated people, but with the way COVID mutates, vaccination proves to be less and less effective, allowing COVID outbreaks to harm even those who are vaccinated. Yet, it seems that way too many people are taking things casually, ignoring the threat of COVID. This is why so many people, even if they manifest significant symptoms indicating they might be infected with COVID, not only do not get themselves tested to see if they have it, they go about their lives as if they are not a threat to others; they go to work, to the store, to the church, coughing and sneezing without consideration of others, that is, without even taking basic precautions which could help save someone’s life (like wearing a mask). Indifference is especially seen in churches, churches which often only followed lockdown rules with the greatest reluctance. This is why, once lockdowns were removed: so many of them acted as if everything is normal and COVID should no longer a concern, indeed, that its threat was and remains overblown. Churches should know better. The preservation of life, the dignity of life, should be a concern of theirs. Instead of fighting the government on COVID, they should have been some of its greatest supporters, making sure indifference did not lead to needless deaths. Those who ignored COVID or were indifferent to it, and encouraged others to likewise be indifferent, must be seen as being at least partially culpable for all the needless deaths that occurred. They did not provide for their family, nor their community, with what was necessary for its preservation. Such indifference, Scripture suggests, indicates a lack of fidelity to the Gospel: “If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever” (1 Tim. 5:8 RSV).\nCOVID continues to be a threat. Currently, China is dealing with a major COVID-related disaster as they are experiencing another round of massive COVID infections and hospitalizations. It is said that they have had about 250 million COVID infections in December:\nIn more than three decades of emergency medicine, Beijing-based doctor Howard Bernstein said, he has never seen anything like this. \nPatients are arriving at his hospital in ever-increasing numbers; almost all are elderly and many are very unwell with COVID and pneumonia symptoms, he said. \nBernstein’s account reflects similar testimony from medical staff across China who are scrambling to cope after China’s abrupt U-turn on its previously strict COVID policies this month was followed by a nationwide wave of infections.[Source:article]\nThis, of course, is affecting China’s economy, and as such, will affect the rest of the world: The rapid spread of infection has driven many people indoors and emptied shops and restaurants. Factories and companies are also forced to shut down or cut production because of more workers getting sick. [Source:article]\nThis could give the rest of the world a terrible foreshadowing of what is to come, because, as precedent shows us, what happens in China will soon be experienced by others as well. And, to be sure, while in the United States, things are better than they were, we must not ignore that COVID still is a threat, and many, especially the elderly, are needlessly dying from it because of the indifference we have taken towards it:\nSo far this winter, the rise in Covid-19 appears to be relatively mild – hospitalizations are ticking up in most states, although the overall rate is still just a fraction of what it was during other surges. \nBut for older adults like Stewart, the situation is much more severe. Hospitalizations among seniors are nearing the peak from the Delta surge and rising fast. \nAnd the age gap has never been wider. Since October, the Covid-19 hospitalization rate among seniors has been at least four times higher than average. Even during the first winter surge in 2020, when Covid-19 took a devastating sweep through nursing homes, there was never more than a three-fold difference.[Source:article]\nWe must no longer act as if the threat of COVID is mostly behind us; we must face the fact that, in reality, COVID continues to threaten us all. While we certainly have a better way to deal with it than we did at the beginning of the pandemic, we are not in the clear. COVID continues to mutate, threatening to overcome the medicine we have to deal with it. And, it is clear, many politicians are pushing an agenda to make us grow indifferent to COVID, to think it really is not a serious problem and that all the engagements we have done to deal with it are worse than COVID itself. They would have us forget the millions of deaths associated with COVID, and look away when we see people still dying from it. Sadly, we find many of those who otherwise claim to promote and support the dignity of life are among those who are at the forefront in denying COVID concerns. Their words echo the sentiments of Cain, as they continue to suggest, in one fashion or another, we should not be our brother (or neighbor’s) keeper (and protector). They say this do deny government the power and authority it needs to properly deal with the pandemic. It is, as St. John Paul II understood, the thinking of the evil one which encourages such deadly indifference:\nAt the root of every act of violence against one’s neighbour there is a concession to the “thinking” of the evil one, the one who “was a murderer from the beginning” (Jn 8:44). As the Apostle John reminds us: “For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother” (1 Jn 3:11-12). Cain’s killing of his brother at the very dawn of history is thus a sad witness of how evil spreads with amazing speed: man’s revolt against God in the earthly paradise is followed by the deadly combat of man against man. [Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nThose who promote this difference use a deadly ideology (such as libertarianism) as a way to defend their position; but, it is clear, whatever ideology is used to support such indifference, in the end, it proves to be rather murderous in the way it ignores and denigrates concerns of mass deaths:\nAfter the crime, God intervenes to avenge the one killed. Before God, who asks him about the fate of Abel, Cain, instead of showing remorse and apologizing, arrogantly eludes the question: “I do not know; am I my brother’s keeper?” (Gen 4:9). “I do not know”: Cain tries to cover up his crime with a lie. This was and still is the case, when all kinds of ideologies try to justify and disguise the most atrocious crimes against human beings. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”: Cain does not wish to think about his brother and refuses to accept the responsibility which every person has towards others. We cannot but think of today’s tendency for people to refuse to accept responsibility for their brothers and sisters. Symptoms of this trend include the lack of solidarity towards society’s weakest members-such as the elderly, the infirm, immigrants, children- and the indifference frequently found in relations between the world’s peoples even when basic values such as survival, freedom and peace are involved. [Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nWe can and must do better. We must not be indifferent. We must not let people needlessly die just because the way to save them requires some action from us which, though it is but a minor inconvenience for us, we will fight to make sure we are not required to do it (such as wearing a mask during a pandemic). Every time we find ourselves facing a threat to the livelihood of many people in our society, we find ourselves being challenged by God to do what we can to protect and preserve life as much as is possible. We are, as it were, given a chance to prove our good will, or else, to show how much we are like Cain:\nShortly after its account of the creation of the world and of man, the Bible takes up the issue of human relationships. Cain kills his brother Abel and then hears God ask: “Where is your brother Abel?” (Gen 4:9). His answer is one that we ourselves all too often give: “Am I my brother’s keeper?” (ibid.). By the very question he asks, God leaves no room for an appeal to determinism or fatalism as a justification for our own indifference. Instead, he encourages us to create a different culture, in which we resolve our conflicts and care for one another. [Source:Pope St. John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae]\nAs China shows us, COVID continues to be a worldwide threat. We must not let our guard down. We must not be indifferent to its concerns. We must continue to do what we can to help stop its spread and lessen the harm it can cause to those who are infected by it. We must take sound precautions, some which will also prove helpful in dealing with other potential threats like RSV and the flu. We should not act as if those who get sick and die would have otherwise died anyway and so should not be our concern; not only do we not know that would have happened, but if we think that, we show, once again, how little we value life. We must embrace what St John Paul II said, which is, the value of our neighbor, making sure we not only are not indifferent to them, but we love them:\nThis renewed life-style involves a passing from indifference to concern for others, from rejection to acceptance of them. Other people are not rivals from whom we must defend ourselves, but brothers and sisters to be supported. They are to be loved for their own sakes, and they enrich us by their very presence.

Now, Amro joins MintPress to recount the horrifying realities faced by Palestinians at the hands of their Israeli occupiers.\n\nComing back to his house on October 7, world-renowned activist Issa Amro was dragged away by 15 armed Israelis, blindfolded, gagged, and cuffed so tightly he now needs an operation on his hands. The settlers and soldiers kept him imprisoned for days, beating and torturing him, constantly simulating his execution.\nSpeaking with MintPress News, Amro told the story of what life is like for Palestinians living in the West Bank city of Hebron. “In my city where I live now, since October 7, there is a curfew,” he told Mnar Adley and Alan MacLeod.\nBut this curfew is far more restrictive than others. Palestinian families – those who have not already fled the genocidal Israeli violence – are given only six hours a week to leave their homes. They are not even allowed out into their own yards. This means that school has stopped, work has ended, and life is on pause.\nIn those six hours, Palestinian families must buy all their food, pick up essentials such as medicine and conduct any social activities. But being outside is dangerous, as they have to pass though multiple checkpoints with armed guards and AI smart shooters pointing guns at them. Violence from vigilante settler groups is also a danger.\n“It’s scary to walk alone between armed soldiers and armed settlers, all of them pointing their guns at you. Then, when you come back, it takes them five to ten minutes to search every person,” Amro said, revealing that the guards wanted to go so far as to cut open his potatoes and tomatoes to check for “weapons.”\n“It’s a kind of jail” right now, Amro said, although he notes that being in jail is considerably safer than being a Palestinian in Hebron right now.\nIssa Amro is an activist and the co-founder of the grassroots group Youth Against Settlements. He has led campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience against apartheid and Israeli occupation and has been recognized and given awards by international organizations, including the United Nations. He joins MintPress to chronicle recent Israeli attempts to force Palestinians from their homes and their ancestral land.\nWhile leaving the house is extremely dangerous, staying inside is barely safer. Amro and others have experienced Israeli raids where troops tell Palestinians that they have 24 hours to leave or they will be murdered.\n“History is repeating itself,” Amro told Adley and MacLeod today, “Now I understand why my people left in 1948,” referencing the Israeli genocide of three-quarters of a million Palestinians from their land in order to create the state of Israel.\nIt is no exaggeration to call the current Israeli actions genocidal. Indeed, senior Israeli politicians are directly comparing it to the events of 1948. Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, for example, described his country’s actions as the “Gaza Nakba 2023.” “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba,” he told local outlet Channel 12 on Saturday. “From an operational point of view, there is no way to wage a war – as the Israeli army seeks to do in Gaza – with masses between the tanks and the soldiers,” he added.",

The idea that COVID-19 vaccines could contain the “mark of the beast” — a reference to a prophecy in the Book of Revelation that says the Antichrist will mark unclean Christians to exclude them from heaven — is there Purchase won in many conservative Christian circles.\nLadapo’s other dubious activities reportedly include altering the results of a study to suit his anti-vaccination stances, recommending that healthy children not be vaccinated and claiming that masks have not saved lives.",

        "article": "Is COVID China’s Chernobyl?\n\nThirty-five years ago, the nuclear disaster known to the world as Chernobyl brought discredit at home and abroad to an inept and corrupt Soviet communist regime and signaled the end of the Soviet Union. In February 2020, I wrote a piece wondering whether the coronavirus outbreak, as we called it then, might spell a similar doom for China’s communist regime. Although no one saw fit to publish the essay then, the eerie parallels between the two disasters continue to be provocative.\nIt was on April 26, 1986, that the No. 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat (in what is today Ukraine), suffered a massive explosion — large enough to blow the 2,000-ton reactor casting straight through the reactor building’s roof. Even so, it wasn’t until traces of radioactive fallout were detected at a Swedish nuclear facility the next day that Soviet citizens began to hear of what had happened from foreign news sources — as did the rest of the world.\nThe number of short-term deaths from the disaster (those who died immediately or in the weeks or months thereafter from radiation sickness) is about 54; estimates of long-term deaths as a result of exposure to radiation vary widely, from thousands to tens of thousands and even much higher.\nThe Chernobyl disaster cost the Soviet regime whatever credibility it had with its citizens and was the last nail in the coffin for the image of Soviet communism abroad. For the current Chinese communist regime in Beijing, the growing evidence that COVID does not have zoonotic origins — that it did not jump from animals to humans — as China still claims, but most likely leaked from a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, points to culpability for a global disaster far worse than Chernobyl: so much so that it is not unreasonable to speculate about its implications for the regime’s survival.\nMoreover, there is evidence that the Chinese government covered up the severity of the outbreak in China while allowing the virus to spread abroad. Thus it’s also possible to speculate that Beijing saw the COVID crisis not as a tragedy but as an opportunity to disrupt economies and societies around the world, to China’s advantage.\nCould the international furor over COVID reach a point where Xi Jinping’s colleagues decide he makes a convenient scapegoat and turn him out? Given that he has modeled his reign after Mao’s ruthless one-man rule and grip on power, that may be unlikely. Even if it were to come to pass, Beijing’s total surveillance state would prevent Chinese citizens from learning anything like the truth of what happened in Wuhan, and why.\nWhen the Chernobyl disaster struck, the Soviet regime was already on its last legs. By contrast, China’s bid for global hegemony is just starting to crest. It is an essential part of the Chinese Communist Party’s identity, regardless of what happens to Xi. China’s leadership has been engaged in a long march to global power since Mao Zedong came to power in 1949. Mao’s successors, starting with Deng Xiaoping, have committed themselves wholeheartedly to that epic journey.\nDespite the friendly face he showed to the West, it was Deng who first described relations with the U.S. as a “cold war” and who made it clear to his colleagues, if not to the outside world, that the goal of his market reforms of the Chinese economy was to “enrich the state and strengthen the military.” What Westerners assumed were reforms to integrate China into the global economic system were actually steps aimed at dominating and controlling that system in order to achieve hegemony.\nIn the 1990s, Deng’s chosen successor as general secretary of the CCP, Jiang Zemin, launched China on a course of massive military buildup; in the first decades of this century, Hu Jintao engineered China’s high-tech total surveillance state, including the Great Firewall, and launched a Chinese cyber-offensive that stole hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of intellectual property from an unsuspecting world — the biggest transfer of wealth in history.\nXi’s grandiose Belt and Road initiative and his Made in China 2025 master plan are only building on the superstructure his predecessors established to make China the world’s dominant superpower by any means necessary — possibly including using, or taking advantage of, the COVID pandemic as a way to hobble the economies of China’s rivals, particularly the United States.\nIndeed, China’s surge into recombinant DNA research, as outlined in Xi’s 14th Five-Year Development Plan, could signal Beijing’s interest in scouting out an even more virulent agent as a potential bioweapon.\nIt’s to be hoped, though, that the world did draw lessons from Chernobyl, which revealed the moral bankruptcy of the regime that allowed it to happen and then tried to cover it up. COVID, in turn, has taught us a sobering lesson about the risks we all run in collaborating with or appeasing Beijing.\nThree million dead, tens of trillions of dollars lost worldwide: It’s a terrible price to pay for ignoring the present and future threat posed by a power-obsessed regime.",

        "article": "Capitalism Is Curing COVID-19, Government Is Making It Worse\n\nIt seems wherever you go on the left, you can find a hot take about how free market capitalism is endangering the world at a time when we need unprecedented wartime-like planning and coordination.\nNew York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio argued, “This is a case for a nationalization, literally a nationalization, of crucial factories and industries that could produce the medical supplies to prepare this country for what we need.”\nThe Atlantic published a think piece arguing “There Are No Libertarians In An Epidemic.” Mic.com joined in with a similar message, and the further-left Jacobin Magazine and The Nation both argued that now more than ever we need to socialize medicine. And of course such takes abound in exponential amounts on social media.\nThis is hardly just an American problem. The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper that has been regularly accused of being a mouthpiece for the Communist Party of China—since its purchase by Alibaba Group and Jack Ma, a member of the party—published a letter attacking “the laissez-faire approach to the economy” for supply shortages along with a whole host of social ills and asking the government to “step in.”\nThe truth is just the opposite. In China, America, and nations around the globe, catastrophic government failures have allowed this virus to become a crisis, and it’s businesses that are successfully stepping up to save lives.\nPresident Trump brought attention to many such cases in a news conference.\nHoneywell is opening two new manufacturing facilities to produce N95 masks, eventually leading to five times their current production. Jockey International is stepping up production of medical gowns and donated 10,000 scrubs to frontline medical workers in New York.\nUnited Technologies donated 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment to FEMA. MyPillow is converting its call centers to help with the pandemic and is converting 75 percent of its manufacturing to producing facemasks.\nMuch of the left—rather than appreciating this—has instead expressed concern about the company’s CEO discussing his religious beliefs at the podium. Right or wrong, that’s not the story here.\nAdditionally, Facebook is donating 720,000 N95 masks, Goldman Sachs 600,000 and Apple 10 million. Meanwhile, the federal government had 1.5 million of them sitting in a warehouse, incapable of figuring out how to release them in a timely manner.\nSimilar stories are occurring around the world. In the United Kingdom, vacuum tycoon James Dyson designed an entirely new ventilator and is manufacturing 15,000 of them. In Japan, Sharp has converted TV factories to produce surgical masks. Foxconn the same in China.\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was producing defective test kits (and in insufficient numbers), private companies like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics stepped up to develop and rush to market functional test kits. That’s according to reporting from The New York Times.\nIt was also The New York Times that broke the appalling story of how early on in the international spread of coronavirus, the government prevented doctors in Washington state, funded by the private Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, from testing samples from people suffering flu symptoms to determine if they were positive for COVID-19.\nBoth the state and federal governments refused to provide approval for weeks; when out of ethics concerns the doctors began testing the samples illegally, they discovered a case in a local teenager, but by then he’d already had far too much time unquarantined and was likely infecting others.\nThe teenager’s school shut down, but even then the state government told the doctors to “stop testing.” They went to the FDA to get their test approved, but the FDA told them approval wasn’t possible because the lab wasn’t certified under CMS regulations.\nAfter an “extraordinary and rare” plea was made to the FDA commissioner, he responded that they must still submit the tests for emergency authorization. But even the emergency process takes far too long, with one doctor complaining “this virus is faster than the FDA” as he was asked to mail documents to the FDA instead of email.\nIf the government had acted differently, many lives might have been saved. That was true in China too, where a doctor noticed early cases of COVID-19 and feared an epidemic. He tried to get the word out, but the police accused him of “making false comments” and disturbing the “social order.” That doctor has since died of COVID-19.\nWhere our government has stepped in to take positive action, they’ve often failed miserably. The federal coronavirus bill provided $25 million to keep the Kennedy Center operational, yet even with that massive amount they’ve laid off staff, leading lawmakers to try to claw back the subsidy.\nIn New York, the state government is experimenting with exactly what DeBlasio wanted: nationalizing the production of hand sanitizer. Gov. Andrew Cuomo claims they can produce it cheaper than private enterprise. How is that possible? Modern slave labor. They’re paying prisoners 16 cents an hour to produce the product.\nThe most successful government interventions to help in this crisis seem to have been getting out of the way.\nAmericans for Tax Reform has logged more than 250 regulations that have been waived to help with the crisis, many of which it’s baffling why they ever existed. That includes waiving regulations that prevented the development of telemedicine, now more necessary than ever.\nThis freeing of enterprise to fight in this crisis is a clear story of the success of capitalism. And none of the above even mentioned the everyday examples we take for granted of how capitalism has made living in this time possible.\nWe have Amazon, Postmates, and more making it possible to survive without needing to go out. We have the internet and phones allowing us to stay connected with our friends and family. We have computer technologies allowing many of us to continue our employment remotely. Imagine how much worse the unemployment crisis would be without capitalism!\nTo pick this time of all times to say the free markets is failing us is sheer lunacy.",

        "article": "There May Have Been Far More People Fighting Covid Tyranny Than We Thought, but Their Voices Are Only Just Now Being Heard\n\nFor four years, we’ve carried around a presumption that when lockdowns came, most people went along out of fear of the virus. Or maybe people were just intimidated by the propaganda, which was overwhelming. Then the “mass formation” (madness of crowds) kicked in and tossed out their wits in favor of following the myth to absurd extents.\nThat’s a conventional version of what happened.\nAnd yet, we keep hearing of early voices of dissent at the time that didn’t get a hearing.\nThe problem of figuring out whether and to what extent people acquiesced to tyranny is an important one. It is complicated by accumulating evidence that the government worked with tech and media, and therefore with the main way people get their news, to actively suppress contrary voices, even when they came from recognized experts of great credibility.\nDid you see the movie The Big Short? It is based on a book by Michael Lewis. Both celebrate short-selling contrarian Michael Burry of Scion Capital. Back in 2006, he began to see strange features of the housing bubble. These financial products called mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) packed highly-rated mortgage bonds with terribly-rated ones. The more he looked, the more he was convinced that a massive housing bust was on the way.\nHe shorted the market, even going to the point of pushing various financial firms to create funds that did just that even when they didn’t previously exist. Very few believed there was a bubble in housing because all the experts, including the head of the central bank, said otherwise. The whole system was propping up a fake market.\nBurry, who is a trained physician, believed it was going to fail. He had looked at the details instead of trusting the experts. And he turned out to be correct, perhaps early but correct eventually. The movie and book present him as a hero for being willing to go against the crowd and the experts both.\nThe lesson: we should all be more like Burry. Even since the telling of this story, he has been valorized as a person of great wisdom. Never trust the experts, the system, the conventional wisdom, the madness of crowds. Do your own research like Burry did!\nWhen the lockdowns began in March 2020, it turns out that Dr. Burry joined Twitter solely for the purpose of denouncing what was going on. He sent emails too, to Bloomberg. Burry wrote them right away:\nStay-at-home policies need not be universal. COVID-19 is a disease that is somewhat lethal for the obese, the very old, the already-sick. Public policies have no nuance because they want to maximize fear to enforce compliance. But universal stay-at-home policies devastate small and medium sized business and indirectly beat up women and children, kill and create drug addicts, engender suicides, and in general create tremendous misery and mental anguish. These secondary and tertiary effects are getting no play in the prevailing narratives.\nAmong his statements on Twitter:\nAmericans must not abide. Government restrictions are doing orders of magnitude more damage to the lives of Americans than COVID could ever have done on its own.\nRoughly 2.8 million people die in the US each year. The worst estimates for COVID would add less than 10% to that total. Consider this as the media implies Americans are dying at multiples of normal rates. Compassion is not incompatible with facts.\nUnconscionable. Let’s put today’s horrific jobless claims in perspective. This is not the virus. This is the response to the virus killing the US and global economy, with all accompanying human tragedy. I present America’s initial jobless claims over the decades.\n15 million mortgage defaults? An unemployment rate exceeding 10%? Social unrest can be expected as it passes 20%. Unthinkable in America. Just two months ago the economy was great. A virus shows up that kills less than 0.2%, and the government does THIS?\nCOVID like all coronaviruses will not easily engender durable herd immunity, and vaccines will prove elusive. We must learn to live with it – which means universal treatment with available drugs and no hysteria, i.e. NO LOCKDOWN!\nHe later took down the tweets and deleted his accounts, maybe out of despair of making any difference. We don’t know. Nor do we know how many retweets or likes he received or what the comments were, simply because they are no longer there. (If anyone can figure out how to find this, please let me know; I’ve checked every outlet.)\nGiven Burry’s status as a genuine contrarian expert, in the midst of a grotesque policy without precedent, you might have thought that the media would be all over him. He would be on all the talk shows. Experts would address his claims, refuting them or backing them.\nWhat happened instead was: nothing.\nIn those days, I was desperate to find voices of disagreement. I really could not find any. I felt very alone. So too, as it turns out, did many others. There were many of us, as it turns out. We just couldn’t find each other. Or maybe certain algorithms were in place that prevented us from finding each other.\nThere seemed to be this strange trend alive at the time. The recognized experts of the past were all swept away. Many had their accounts deleted. They were replaced by new experts about whom we knew almost nothing or who had severely compromised reputations, like Anthony Fauci.\nAn example is Devi Sridhar, who advised the Scottish government. More than anyone else, she was granted astonishing amounts of airtime throughout the UK. She was a proponent of the idea of “Zero Covid” through lockdowns and, later, vaccines. She now admits that this was an error, that we do indeed need to live with the virus. But her book from that period she still promotes on all her social media accounts.\nDid they have any track records we could check? How do we know these people are real experts? These were questions hardly anyone asked.\nHow is it that Sridhar was the go-to expert whereas other experts were throttled, blocked, denounced, canceled, and deleted? Perhaps because she worked for the Gates Foundation? It’s impossible not to become a conspiracy theorist to some extent as you look at this situation.\nThere is no reason to go all the way to October with the experts who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration. They faced extreme attacks. But really the attempts to curate the public mind and engineer a consensus began as soon as the lockdowns took effect.\nThe same agency that meddled so heavily in information curation was also the agency that broke up the workforce between essential and nonessential, and later on dismissed the risks of absentee ballots even though their internal memos reveal vast awareness. That would be the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA. Created in 2018 and practically invisible to most Americans, this small agency exercised enormous power over what we knew and what we heard.\nMeanwhile, we’ve been hearing about many dissidents who were trying to speak out early on and could not get a hearing, many of whom now write for Brownstone.\nThink how different 2008 would have been with the same level of speech control. Markets would not have corrected toward reality so quickly. It’s one thing for a truth to be unpopular or unconventional; it’s something else to be actively suppressed.\nLooking back, one really does wonder what the reality was in those early days after lockdown. No question that mass formation played a huge role. No question that people gave in and complied far more than they should have. But what if government had not been collaborating with tech and media and just allowed the free flow of information? Might the lockdowns have ended much sooner simply because people could have heard a different point of view?\nWe’ll never know. This does serve as a cautionary note against a wholesale condemnation of the world for failing to stand up to tyranny. Maybe many people did stand up, in whatever limited way they could, but simply faced a system that prevented them from getting a hearing.",

        "article": "Something So Strange About The 'Covid' Death Toll Numbers In America And In China - MSM Finally Admits So Called Covid Deaths Could Actually Be Covid 'Vaccine-Related' Deaths\n\nOnce in a while we can garner some truths from the MSM in America. Of course we have to hunt, mix and match their propaganda up, and then hunt some more before putting the pieces of the puzzle together. Even then their biases, and willingness to twist themselves into pretzels to fit the preferred narrative is easily seen....at least by those with their eyes open.\nFrankly it is sometimes easier to list their lies than to find truth in their reporting, if it doesn't fit the official narrative.\nIn this article we will be discussing some very strange covid vaccine-related information we have found in our search for truth.\nWhile China revises the death toll numbers upward by tens of thousands, American media now admits that we have been overcounting covid deaths in the U.S.\nAt the center of everything are covid vaccines and boosters.\n\nCOVID DEATHS THAT WEREN'T.....\nMore than two years after Independent Media, including ANP, reported that not all counted covid deaths were from covid, and they were just being listed as covid deaths, the MSM discovers that not all counted covid deaths were from covid.\nThe first report we will cite was written on January 13, 2023, by Washington Post contributor Leana S. Wen.\nI'll ask readers to remember that name because we will be discussing her previous assertions more a little further down.\nThe title of the opinion piece by Ms. Wen, is \"We are overcounting covid deaths and hospitalizations. That’s a problem.\"\nYa think?\nHere are some key paragraphs for readers to consider:\n• Two infectious-disease experts I spoke with believe that the number of deaths attributed to covid is far greater than the actual number of people dying from covid. Robin Dretler, an attending physician at Emory Decatur Hospital and the former president of Georgia’s chapter of Infectious Diseases Society of America, estimates that at his hospital, 90 percent of patients diagnosed with covid are actually in the hospital for some other illness.\n• Dretler also sees patients with multiple concurrent infections. “People who have very low white blood cell counts from chemotherapy might be admitted because of bacterial pneumonia or foot gangrene. They may also have covid, but covid is not the main reason why they’re so sick.”\n• If these patients die, covid might get added to their death certificate along with the other diagnoses. But the coronavirus was not the primary contributor to their death and often played no role at all.\nSo, it is quite possible that up to 90 percent of listed covid deaths weren't actually deaths from covid.\n\nCHINA REVISES 'COVID' DEATHS UPWARD BY 59,000+\nWe'll get back to Ms. Wen, in detail, after discussing the news coming out of China, where there is a \"alleged\" new strain of covid.\nI have literally lost count of how many alleged \"new strains\" we have seen reported, but that is for another article.\nChina list 37 deaths from between Dec. 7 and Jan. 8. By January 15, that number had been revised upward to 60,000.\nChina on Saturday made a significant revision of its official death toll in the latest outbreak of the coronavirus — to nearly 60,000 deaths linked to covid-19 since December, when pandemic restrictions were lifted and infections surged across the country, up from just 37.\nThe announcement follows criticism by international health experts and complaints by citizens that the government has been understating the number of deaths caused by the virus.\nAuthorities have recently come under added scrutiny following reports of overwhelmed funeral homes and hospitals. A report by The Washington Post last week documented a surge in traffic outside funeral homes, according to satellite imagery, firsthand videos and interviews with crematorium staff and residents.\nChina was undercounting them while America was overcounting them? As I said earlier, strange.\nThe strangeness doesn't end there though.\n\nCOVID DEATHS OR COVID VACCINE DEATHS?\nWe have all seen the constant stream of \"died suddenly\" stories since the vaccine rollout in 2021, just as we have seen the nonstop MSM stories of covid pandemic of the \"unvaccinated.\"\nThat too was a theme of propaganda for liberal media outlets, right up until they finally quietly admitted that it the vaccinated that are dying in larger numbers than the unvaccinated, or the \"purebloods\" as they have been dubbed.\nNovember, Wapo again: \"Vaccinated people now make up a majority of covid deaths\"\nThey begin with \"It’s no longer a pandemic of the unvaccinated.\"\nNewsflash: It never was.\nMake no mistake, they are still pushing people to get vaxxed in that piece, because they are still blaming covid for those deaths.\nNow rather than using my bias against the covid vaccines due their ultra fast rollout with no time to test for detrimental long term effects, we'll let a couple other headlines make this next point.\nOmicron subvariant XBB.1.5 possibly more likely to infect those who are vaccinated, officials say\nAre Vaccines Fueling New Covid Variants?\nThe \"official narrative\" claims differently but the fact that so-called covid deaths are now higher in vaccinated people than alleged covid deaths for unvaccinated people, pretty much negates the denials.\nIf the vaccinated are more likely to catch and die from covid that purebloods, does that not make those death covid vaccine-related rather than covid deaths? Without the vaccine those people may have not caught covid, therefore may not have died.\nBack to Ms. Wen. In July 2021, Stefan Stanford highlighted Leana Wen, who is also a CNN talking head, who declared that \"Life Needs To Be Hard For Unvaccinated Americans.\"\nAnd while ANP has emailed Dr. Wen at the email address listed on this linked webpage, asking her what her ties are to Communist China since she's pushing full-scale medical tyranny, we're not surprised that Dr. Wen has not gotten back to us. Though as Slavo pointed out in his story, Wen is quite unhappy that unvaccinated people can 'go about their lives as normal without any consequence'. Yes, how absolutely horrifying that free Americans are 'allowed' to be free! Though as we've pointed out time and time again on ANP, free people don't get their rights from government but God. Dr. Wen should go to China if she doesn't like it here in America.\nStefan does have a way with words!\nOn December 25, in an ANP article by Joel S Hirschhorn of the Pandemic Blunder Newsletter, we see Ms. Wen backpedaled previous calls for medical tyranny, and admitted that immunity is far more effective against covid than vaccines.\nOne of many liberals who showed their true totalitarian faces by suggesting those who were unvaccinated need to lose rights and privileges, with moves being made by the totalitarian left to accomplish that to this very day, Dr. Wen just made a HUGE 'about face' on those earlier remarks in a recent Washington Post article (saved at wayback machine), dropping this bombshell upon herself and all of those still pushing for 'vaccine passports' by reporting on numerous new studies showing the vaccinated are MUCH LESS protected from COVID than the unvaccinated who have already had COVID. A little bit late, Dr. Wen.\n\nA CONNECTION BETWEEN VACCINES AND ALLEGED 'COVID' DEATHS?\nLooking back to China now, we see a report from January 13, 2023, explaining that China is the global leader of vaccine support.\nCities in China also mandates vaccines, via CNN:\nBeijing on Wednesday announced a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for residents to enter public venues, becoming the first city in mainland China to do so as it attempts to contain a highly infectious Omicron subvariant.\nFrom July 11, people will need to show proof of vaccination to enter a wide range of public places in the Chinese capital, including cinemas, libraries, museums, gyms, stadiums and training centers, a city health official told a news briefing Wednesday.\nPeople who are “not suitable” for vaccination will be exempted from the requirement, the official added, without clarifying how they can provide proof for exemption.\nWuhan, China is where covid originated, and the Chinese have their own vaccines.\nThis begs the question of how many of China's recent 60,000 deaths from \"covid\", revised upwards from 37, were vaccinated individuals?\nAnother question to be asked, considering America has been overcounting covid deaths, how many of the ones not matching the \"overcounted\" criteria, were vaccinated?\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nNot only are we seeing an unprecedented amount of \"sudden\" deaths, especially of the young and athletes, but we also have no idea how many so-called \"covid\" deaths are really from people that caught covid because their immune system was compromised by the covid vaccines and boosters.",

        "article": "Myth vs. Reality in COVID Russia\n\nIt's time to part ways with the conscience-soothing fairytales\n\n“Sputnik V is safe!”; “Putin is just ‘playing along’ with the COVID narrative until the petrodollar collapses!”; “Russia is the last bastion of freedom!”…\nAlternative media has created an alternative reality about Russia. The Kremlin has embraced all the same soul-raping “public health measures” currently terrorizing the Western world—and people are either in denial or making excuses:\n\n“There is no compulsory vaccination in Russia!”\nAll 85 federal subjects of the Russian Federation now have vaccine mandates, as well as rules requiring digital “health” certificates for entry to certain businesses, venues, and public institutions. Many regions are denying routine medical care to those without QR codes.\nAt the federal level, the Kremlin has voiced support for “any measures” that “encourage” Russians to get jabbed—while insisting vaccination remains completely voluntary.\nA sample of regional flavors of “voluntary” vaccination in Russia:\nIn the Novgorod region, children whose parents have not been vaccinated are banned from afterschool clubs and other extracurricular activities.\nDigital vaccine passports will be required to use public transport in Tatarstan. The new regulation applies to all residents over the age of 18 without a medical exemption.\nIn St. Petersburg, a negative PCR test cannot be used to obtain a QR code. This means theaters, museums and restaurants in Russia’s second-largest city are reserved exclusively for the vaccinated and those with proof of prior infection.\nMuscovites over the age of 60 have been ordered to self-isolate until the end of February. Those who have been vaccinated or have proof of prior infection are exempt from the rule.\nProbably you read somewhere that Vladimir Putin outlawed compulsory vaccination as part of his master plan to destroy the fractional reserve banking system and bring peace and harmony to the world. Someone lied to you. Sorry about that.\n\n“…But Sputnik V is safe!”\nDoes the Kremlin have access to a time-bending wormhole? Because we keep reading boastful claims about the non-existent results of Sputnik V’s “long-term” (ha-ha) safety and efficacy trials—which are scheduled to end on December 31, 2022.\nLike other COVID vaccines, Sputnik V has zoomed through clinical trials, with an “interim” report consisting of six months’ worth of data used as proof of its unassailable long-term safety and efficacy. It didn’t help that this already limited dataset was plagued by controversy (as well as an alarming lack of transparency).\nPhase III vaccine trials typically require at least five years of careful observation. For example, the long-term safety study for J&J’s Ebola vaccine—which uses the same Ad26 viral vector platform as Sputnik V—began in 2016 and won’t end until 2023.\nAlexander Redko, chairman of the St. Petersburg Professional Association of Medical Workers, noted in July that declaring Sputnik V “safe” without even waiting for ludicrous-speed clinical trials to end is about as scientific as reading tarot cards. Is he wrong? The Russian government clearly thinks so.\nIn December 2020, Russia’s health ministry announced it was prematurely ending enrollment for Sputnik V trials, arguing that it would be unethical to administer placebo shots when a proven, life-saving vaccine was already available to the public.\n“Everything has now been proven, while the pandemic is ongoing,” Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Center—which developed Sputnik V—explained, just four months after Phase III trials had begun.\nScience-deniers claim it’s irresponsible to coerce tens of millions of people to get injected with an untested drug, but what these conspiracy theorists don’t understand is that any long-term issues would have become apparent within four months.\nFurthermore, Russia has a robust and transparent system in place for flagging side effects.\nThe Russian government does not have a VAERS-like database for reporting and monitoring suspected adverse reactions, and doctors who question the vaccine’s safety or efficacy are being threatened with exorbitant fines and prison time.\n“The fact is that nothing is registered in Russia at all. Therefore, it is very difficult to understand how many serious complications there are. There are many cases, and we can say that they are related to the vaccine. There is a lot to say. Or you can stick your head in the sand and say that there is nothing at all,” Pavel Vorobyov, Chairman of the Moscow Scientific Society of Physicians, said in a recent interview, making him an anti-science hate speech criminal in the eyes of the Russian government.\nArgentina’s health ministry is similarly guilty of High Crimes Against Sputnik V. In October, the South American state revealed that Russia’s flagship vaccine was the nation’s leader when it came to causing adverse reactions, beating Sinopharm and AstraZeneca by significant margins (the full report can be read here):\nThere are even thought crimes being carried out by Russia’s elected representatives. Duma Deputy Mikhail Delyagin argued in an August op-ed that the government’s own data suggested that mass compulsory vaccination had no clear neutralizing effect and was making things worse.\nFor months, the Russian government maintained it was basically impossible to be hospitalized with COVID if you were fully vaccinated. When it became obvious that this was a slight exaggeration, Gamaleya’s director claimed 80% of jabbed Russians falling ill with the virus had purchased fake certificates and were lying about their vaccination status. Gintsburg’s tall tale inspired some colorful commentary in Russian media. As one outlet opined:\nAt first they said that it was enough to get vaccinated once every two years so as not to get sick at all, then once a year, then once every six months. Now it turns out that vaccination does not even really protect against getting into intensive care or death.\nAnd what is the solution? True, the Minister of Health, Mr. Murashko, still claims that there are no deaths among citizens who have received the vaccine. But people do not live on Mars, they, alas, face these deaths of the vaccinated in life ... And then the PR naturally stops working.\nIt’s doubtful if the PR ever worked. Last month, Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Pyotr Tolstoy conceded that the government had completely failed to convince the public that Sputnik V was safe and effective.\n“There are few answers to the questions why those who are vaccinated are ill, why those who are vaccinated die, why there are problems and complications after the vaccinations themselves,” the high-ranking lawmaker said.\nThe total lack of transparency has spurred the creation of informal databases and Telegram channels where adverse events can be tracked. Instead of stepping up efforts to address safety concerns, the Russian government has compared concerned citizens to terrorists.\nThe Kremlin and its credulous cheerleaders maintain that there’s no need to worry about long-term safety because Sputnik V is based on the Gamaleya Center’s proven, time-tested viral vector-based delivery platform. For example, Kirill Dmitriev, the Harvard-educated ex-Goldman Sachs banker who heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund (which provides financing for Sputnik V), claimed in an op-ed published by RT:\nRussia has benefitted from modifying for COVID-19 an existing two-vector vaccine platform developed in 2015 for Ebola fever, which went through all phases of clinical trials and was used to help defeat the Ebola epidemic in Africa in 2017.\nBut on Sputnik V’s website, we learn:\nAbout 2,000 people in Guinea received injections of Ebola vaccine in 2017-18 as part of Phase 3 clinical trial.\nIs Dmitriev really suggesting that a Phase III trial held in 2017-18 helped Guinea defeat Ebola? That’s quite a brave claim, considering Guinea was declared Ebola-free in June 2016 following an outbreak two years earlier. By the time Gamaleya’s magic Ebola slurry arrived in Guinea (as part of a clinical trial), there was no Ebola left to fight. In February of this year, Guinea reported its first Ebola death since 2016. Can Dmitriev or RT offer some clarification here? Send your questions to RT’s famously fearless and objective Russia Desk.\nBy the way: why would Dmitriev (and Sputnik V’s own website) brag about injecting 2,000 Africans as part of a clinical trial held a year after Guinea was declared Ebola-free? Well, because that’s basically Gamaleya’s greatest triumph—before inventing Sputnik V in record-time.\nSputnik V is the Gamaleya Center’s first “viral vector-based” vaccine to receive emergency use authorization outside of Russia. Gintsburg—who has been the director of Gamaleya since 1997—has yet to bring a fully approved vaccine to market, despite multiple attempts.\nIn fact, Gintsburg’s first vector adenovirus vaccine, AdeVac-Flu, resulted in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal.\n“[Gamaleya’s] scientists have ‘copy-pasted’ [Sputnik V] from their previous, not accepted by the scientific community, research. In their genetic memory—a criminal case, WHO skepticism and zero drugs introduced into the market,” read the teaser of an investigation published by fontanka.ru in July 2020.\nWith such an impressive track record, it’s hardly surprising that the Gamaleya Center refers to itself as “the world’s leading research institution.” The Center also has world-leading facilities. Seriously, feast your eyes upon these cutting-edge facilities: [photos showing an older building with some water damage]\nA lot of Russians are also very impressed by the fact that Sputnik V’s #1 fan (and one of the drug’s original investors) is a friendly banker who is trying to introduce a QR code-based payment system in Russia, and is also developing a digital currency in partnership with JP Morgan.\nWhen your favorite WordPress geopolitical analyst exclaims “Sputnik V is safe!” the appropriate response is: how could you possibly know, and why does the Russian government not want to know?\n\n“…But the Russian government would never deceive its own people!”\nIn June, the emergence of a highly deadly “Moscow strain”—later deemed a “hypothetical phenomenon”—forced authorities to introduce Russia’s first vaccine mandate in the capital. Other regions followed suit. Yes, the people grumbled—but COVID “cases” immediately began to plummet! COVID “deaths” plateaued! It was a true miracle.\nThen something really strange happened: the amazingly effective (but highly unpopular) coercive COVID policies suddenly stopped working immediately after Duma elections in late September.\nWhat a weird coincidence. Obviously, the ruling United Russia party—which had just secured parliament for another five years after an unexpectedly decisive electoral victory—was forced to impose even more coercive COVID policies. If Russians don’t like it, they can express their dissatisfaction at the polls, in 2026.\nRussia’s descent into compulsory vaccination is a case study in industrial-scale lying and government duplicity. It’s a very interesting story.\n\n“…But…but…Putin!”\nIn January, Russia’s president presented a keynote address at the World Economic Forum—his first speech before the esteemed international body since 2009.\nBeginning his address with a very friendly and intimate “dear Klaus,” Putin recalled how he first met Mr. Schwab in 1992 and since then had regularly attended events organized by the Fourth Industrial Revolution visionary.\nPutin used this very important speech to call for “expanding the scale of testing and vaccinations” around the world, describing COVID as an existential threat that required close international cooperation. The entire global economy will need to be rebuilt from the ground up by central banks, because the virus is just so deadly and destructive:\n[T]he key question today is how to build a program of actions in order to not only quickly restore the global and national economies affected by the pandemic, but to ensure that this recovery is sustainable in the long run, relies on a high-quality structure and helps overcome the burden of social imbalances. Clearly, with the above restrictions and macroeconomic policy in mind, economic growth will largely rely on fiscal incentives with state budgets and central banks playing the key role.\nIs that how you say “Build Back Better” in Russian?\nWe’re all trapped in the same oligarch-controlled panpoopticon. Maybe it’s time to accept that, instead of pretending that some jailers are more “based” than others?\nCrazy times. Good luck to all,\nRiley",

        "article": "Gardner Remains Silent on Trump’s Dealings With Ukraine, But Calls on State Department to Name Russia a “State Sponsor of Terror”\n\nU.S. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) remains silent on whether President Donald Trump withheld military assistance to Ukraine — a country actively fighting a Russian-backed insurgency — to try to force an investigation into a political rival, but during a hearing today on the U.S. policy toward Russia, Gardner called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “thug” and urged the State Department to officially list the country as a “state sponsor of terror.”\n“We know that Russia supports terrorist groups,” Gardner, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, charged during a hearing on Tuesday.\nGardner renewed his call to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, citing its invasion of Ukraine, support for authoritarian regimes in Syria and Iran, and responsibility for multiple chemical-based attacks against individuals that they perceived to be threats as evidence.\nEarlier this year, Gardner introduced the Stopping Malign Activities from Russian Terrorism Act with the committee’s ranking member Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ). The bill would require the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress within 90 days of passage on whether Russia fits the criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.\nIn April, Gardner penned an op-ed that laid out the “moral case” for the designation. If the State Department concludes that it should label Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, it would, among other things, place significant restrictions on foreign aid and military equipment.\n“We must take every diplomatic step necessary to protect our allies and our democracy, and to deter a revanchist Russia that is intent on rewriting history and threatening our way of life,” Gardner wrote.\nDespite the tough talk on Russia, including his condemnation of the Ukraine invasion, Gardner has mostly refrained from criticizing Trump policies and statements on Russia, including, most recently, Trump’s re-stated and debunked contention that Ukraine intervened in the U.S. election, when, in fact, Russia promoted the hoax of Ukrainian meddling to conceal Russia’s own meddling.\nAnother point of contention Gardner raised during the hearing was Russian aggression toward NATO allies and the Baltic states — which were previously under Soviet control.\nAccording to the global policy think tank RAND, Russian forces are capable of reaching the capitals of countries like Estonia and Latvia within 60 hours. Lawmakers from both parties called on the Trump administration also to impose sanctions on Turkey — a NATO ally — after it purchased a Russian missile defense system just days before the upcoming NATO summit in London.\nGardner argued that Russia is “clearly an adversary,” and called on the committee to consider a bill that was dubbed the “sanctions bill from hell.” A bipartisan bill introduced earlier this year in the committee would target Putin and the Russian economy in response to their meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the backing of separatist movements in Ukraine, and supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nThe bill would attempt to institutionalize U.S. support for NATO by imposing limits on the president from unilaterally withdrawing from the military alliance. Still, Gardner called on European allies to increase their burden-sharing in curbing Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.\nGardner has acknowledged that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, unlike some of his Republican colleagues.\n“[Russia] is engaged in active information warfare against western democracies, including meddling in the United States’ election in 2016,” Gardner said. Russia, he added, is “clearly an adversary and [continues] to intend to do that in 2020.”",

        "article": "Africa and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nWar is messy and never fails to spread responsive misery. When Adolf Hitler asked for safe passage to East Prussia through the Polish corridor and also for the occupied port of Danzig, not many could have imagined that it would spiral into a world war that would cost 85 million lives and leave an unspeakable trail of devastation in its wake.\nMore than one million Africans died. They were not in Danzig, Berlin or London. They had no idea what Hitler’s request was or why Britain refused to listen to him. They were enlisted for the war by force from Nigeria to Burkina Faso (then Upper Volta), and from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of Congo. On the 75th anniversary of that war two years ago, the few survivors on the continent still bore the scars like yesterday, yet not knowing the reason they went to fight in the first place.\nThere has been nothing like that ever since. On the whole, large scale conflicts have declined even though Iraq, Syria, Darfur and Yemen remind us that the world is never too far away from the base instincts that invited the past atrocities.\nExaggerated comparisons of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hitler have surfaced since the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. But let’s be clear, Putin is not Hitler.\nWhat is not in doubt, however, is that after decades of Russian humiliation following the collapse of the Soviet empire, Putin has been obsessed with the glory of a Russian past which Europe and America have not only stirred but inflamed by aggressively besieging the wounded bear.\nIt’s a bit like the Treaty of Versailles all over again. After defeating Germany during the First World War, the Allies were not content to impose heavy retribution, including the excision of the mineral rich regions of Alsace and Lorraine from Germany. They went ahead to impose a financial penalty of £6.5 billion on Germany, which would have taken the country decades to repay. The victor wanted the vanquished vanquished, never again to rise.\nThe crushing weight of that humiliation was too much for the Germans to bear. The result, of course, was Hitler and the Second World War.\nThe West may not have imposed heavy financial costs on Russia after the collapse of USSR, but Putin, who was at that time an officer in the KGB, saw, first hand, the humiliation that followed the collapse of his country, the triumphalism of the West and its relentless efforts since to crush whatever is left of Russia’s pride and spirit.\nThat is the source of Putin’s rage. Of course, to understand it is not to excuse or justify the current invasion. But to ignore it as the West has mockingly done, is foolish.\nPutin insists that after the former Soviet Union broke up into 15 states, there was an agreement between President Mikhail Gorbachev and the West that NATO will not expand East. NATO has denied the existence of such an agreement, but has barely hidden its subversive encouragement in bringing three countries under the former Soviet Union into its fold, virtually encircling Russia. For Putin, the invasion of Ukraine is his last stand, his push, after Crimea, for Russia’s modern-day Danzig.\nHow is that any of Africa’s business?\nThere have been noises here and there, including, in fact, the threat of sanctions against Russia by a few African countries. The strongest argument from Africa against the invasion is perhaps the one by Kenyan diplomat, Martin Kimani, to the UN: “This situation,” he said, “echoes our history. Kenya and almost every African country, was birthed by the ending of an empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon.”\nKimani was right about that historical fact. However, the truth now as it was in 1884 during the scramble for and partition of Africa, is that in spite of the significant progress that the world has made to establish a rules-based system, the strong, in pursuit of self-interest, will continue to lord it over the weak.\nAfrican states are content to leave the colonial boundaries largely untouched not because they love good neighbourliness any less than Israel loves its Arab neighbours, for example, against whom it has waged one of the longest, bloodiest modern-day wars. Unlike Israel, however, perhaps many African countries do not feel sufficiently threatened by their neighbours or even where such threats may exist, the consequences of aggressive expansion far outweigh the benefits of remaining within their present borders.\nIn short, Africa has remained what it is because of the lack of capacity among its state actors to exact any meaningful change in its border status however much they may desire it.\nIn 2006, for example, Nigeria chose peace instead of war with Cameroun over the Bakassi Peninsula dispute not only because the judgement of the International Court of Justice was unfavourable, but more importantly, because it knew that the negative consequences of taking Bakassi by force far outweighed the benefits. Cameroun, just like the other Francophone states in the subregion, has a defence pact with France which might have been activated if Nigeria, or any other aggressor, attacked.\nIt’s not because Morocco loves Saharawi Arabs or out of deference for the original Spanish-drawn boundaries that it has been unable to seize the territory after decades of a bloody conflict; no. It’s simply because Rabat has lacked the military capacity to enforce and maintain its will.\nWhat Putin is doing is insane, reprehensible and extremely dangerous but both Putin and those who oppose him in the West bear collective responsibility for the horror playing out in Ukraine today. At a time when Ukrainians ought to start getting their lives back after nearly 20 years of corrupt oligarchic reign, followed by a genuine yearning for change which brought Volodymyr Zelensky to power three years ago, the West has escorted Ukraine into a war it will not recover from in a long time.\nAfrican speeches must not cut the US or its Western allies any slack. Cuba was exercising its democratic right as an independent country in 1962 when it permitted the USSR to place missiles on its soil. But President John F. Kennedy said it was over his dead body that this would happen in his backyard. He threatened war until Nikita Khrushchev removed the missiles and pulled back from what would have been the world’s first nuclear war.\nAccording to American historian, Christopher Kelly, and British historian, Stuart Laycock, the US has invaded or fought in 84 countries of the 193 countries recognised by the UN and has been militarily involved with 191 of the 193.\nA story in the Washington Post in March 2016 not counting America’s familiar atrocities, said the US government tried to change other countries’ governments 72 times during the 45-year-long Cold War, an average of more than one every year, possibly earning itself the title of history’s all-time meddler-in-chief. And of course, the consequences of the atrocities of the US and its allies whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya, have not always been pretty.\nBut I’m concerned here about what Russia’s invasion could mean for Africa, especially thousands of students from the continent currently schooling in Ukraine. Although the statistics are scanty, there are reports of at least 8,000 Moroccans and 4,000 Nigerians studying in Kiev and other Ukrainian cities, a good number of them in the medical sciences.\nUnfortunately for these students, their leaders back home will not be in any of the major European capitals where the decisions already being taken to resettle refugees prioritise “Ukrainian Europeans” over other nationalities. Even before the shooting war started, other countries had taken advantage of intelligence and early warning systems to evacuate their citizens and minimise the disruption to their lives.\nAfrica, with perhaps the weakest capacity for a nimble response, waited till war broke out before acting. And yet, this task, far less mundane than contemplating the redrawing of its boundaries, reveals just how hopelessly incompetent the continent’s leaders can be in figuring out their own self-interest.\nRussia knows why it is invading Ukraine, in spite of global condemnation and the unprecedented sanctions it must endure: it is self-interest. And the US and its allies know why in spite of their frustration and anger, they can only watch Russia invade from the sidelines: it is self-interest.\nAs for Africa, the restriction of colonial boundaries is not the only reason it is often confused about its self-interest. Years of mental slavery, poor cultural attitudes, weak and heavily dependent institutions and poor leadership have combined to create boundaries of iron worse than anything that drawers of the geographical boundaries contemplated.\nWhat’s Africa’s interest in Ukraine? A bit more history could be of service in the continent’s quest for an answer.",

        "article": "'What's threatening for Russia is the existence of democratic Ukraine'\n\nEarly on Thursday morning, Russia's president Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation to support the Russia-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk.\nPutin said the mission was to \"protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide\" and said his objectives were the \"demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.\"\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the action as a \"full-scale invasion\" and appealed for allies to send a message to Moscow through strong action.\nFor the people of Ukraine, the future is uncertain. Many have fled their homes and those who remain are living under a state of emergency and a curfew.\nCGTN Europe spoke to Orysia Lutsevych, the Head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House research institution to get to the bottom of the one question on the tip of everyone's tongues: \"What motivates Putin?\"\n\nWhat mindset and strategy is driving Putin's attack?\n\"He wants a political control over Kyiv. He wants to make sure that Kyiv is aligned completely with Russia. He doesn't believe Ukraine deserves to be an independent state, so he will try to take over the capital Kyiv on the attack that he launched in the early days of today. Actually, early hours in that kind of cowardly way while his own citizens were sleeping, especially when we know that a lot of these recordings and his addresses were prerecorded, including the meeting of the National Security Council. So I think he is launching this war in hiding from his own people.\"\n\nWhat is the situation in Ukraine?\n\"Everybody woke up in the new world today, and unfortunately, this world is full of bombs.. What I hear is that this quite big movement of people towards western frontier of Ukraine next to Poland, but also that a lot of people are staying with their families in Kyiv. So far, Russians have been targeting military infrastructure, but they also destroyed several airports in the west of Ukraine. So the whole country is, you know, on one hand in the grip of an aggression. But on the other hand, the Ukrainian armed forces are putting up resistance. It's not 2014. Russia's war came to Ukrainian land in 2014, and I feel sorry that, you know, it has to come again.\"\n\nWhat assistance does Ukraine require from the international community?\n\"It's an aggression or unjustified war. And I see what Ukraine needs is as much support for Ukrainian armed forces to protect the civilians, to protect their land. There has to be assistance in, you know, everything from logistics to medical equipment, evacuation hospitals. Ukraine needs land lease type of economic assistance so that it could purchase necessary things. There has to be a clear message on non-recognition of any illegitimate government that Putin will install and of course, sanctions on Russia. And here, I'll just say one thing: the Russian National Bank holds securities in assets in foreign currency. If Russian central bank is sanctioned, this will cripple the Russian foreign reserves substantially.\"\n\nWhat is the main cause of this crisis in your mind?\n\"This is Russia's own U-turn into more autocratic governance at home, where President Putin is not accountable to anybody and can unilaterally launch a military aggression against the neighbor state. This is at the core of it - NATO is a defensive alliance - was never posing any direct threat to Russian territory, and Ukraine honestly has no perspective of becoming even a NATO member. What was threatening for Russia is the very existence of Ukraine that is governed in a democratic way, not the way Russia is governed today. This is how I see it.\"",

        "article": "What You Need to Know About the Israel-Hamas War\n\nThe situation is chaotic, and the fighting is ongoing. But several observations already stand out.\n\nOn the morning of Oct. 7, the Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out a massive attack on Israel that was nearly unprecedented in its scale and scope. Hamas fired rockets from Gaza and infiltrated its operatives across the border, where they engaged in firefights at seven different locations in southern Israel, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). At least 250 Israelis have been killed, and that number is expected to rise, with over 1,400 more wounded, including at least 18 injured critically and 267 in serious condition. Hamas has also reportedly taken dozens of Israelis hostage, releasing video to support its claims.\nInitial information suggests that the attack has no precedent in recent Israeli history. The IDF said approximately 2,200 rockets were launched in the initial barrages, making it the largest rocket attack against Israel since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. The number of rockets launched was an order of magnitude larger than the attacks at the beginning of the 2014 and 2021 crises. Hamas also appears to have been quite innovative, using paragliders among other means to enter Israel by surprise. The infiltration is particularly devastating for Israel due to the lives lost and the hostages taken.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, “We are at war,” and launched Operation Iron Swords, conducting airstrikes in Gaza and calling up reservists. Al Jazeera reports that the Israeli response has already claimed 232 lives in Gaza, with many more deaths sure to come.\nThe situation is chaotic, and the fighting is ongoing—the ultimate numbers of dead, wounded, and hostages may be far greater than initial reports. Undoubtedly, early information is incomplete, exaggerated in some areas and understated in others, and in some cases plain wrong. But several observations stand out.\n\n1. Hamas was at a dead end.\nHamas has governed Gaza since seizing power there in 2007, and it has always wrestled with the inherent tension between governing the area and maintaining its bona fides as the leader of the anti-Israel resistance camp among Palestinians. Hamas has done so in the face of Israeli and international opposition; tremendous economic pressure that Israel increases or eases to incentivize peace behavior from Hamas; and bitter efforts by its rival, the Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas.\nFor much of the last 16 years, Hamas’s leaders have tried to appeal to Palestinians by showing that they, not the PA, can better govern. And in some ways, they succeeded. Despite international economic isolation, Hamas provides services such as trash collection and law enforcement far more effectively than its PA predecessors in Gaza. Hamas also presented itself as less corrupt than PA leaders, not a difficult argument to make.\nYet Hamas sees itself as a resistance organization and needs to be one politically. Part of this is because its record of governance of Gaza is spotty. Gazans lead difficult lives, with high unemployment and poverty abounding. Hamas’s ability to claim leadership based on the quality of ordinary Palestinians’ lives is limited.\nAt the same time, Hamas’s leaders see Israel as illegitimate and hostile. They believe that attacking Israel is justified and that, in the end, they can gain politically from doing so. They know that ordinary Gazans will pay a terrible price from the Israeli response, but they hope that the eventual political settlement will be in their favor.\nEven if it is simply some variation of the status quo, they aim to gain political points (and by implication discredit the PA) by showing that they, not the PA, are standing up to Israel. They can also shore up support among more extreme elements of their own organization and potential rivals such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which have chafed at what they see as the inaction of Hamas’s leadership.\n\n2. The PA is caught in a Catch-22.\nThe PA is caught in a political trap, wanting to see Hamas fail but unable to openly cheer for Israel. The PA claims to represent all Palestinians, a stance that is incompatible with Hamas’s independent power in Gaza. Abbas and other PA leaders have implicitly supported the isolation of Gaza, and its security forces have worked closely with Israel to crush Hamas in the West Bank, often acting brutally in the process. (Hamas has returned the favor, targeting PA supporters in Gaza.)\nToday, the PA suffers from a legitimacy crisis. With the collapse of the peace process, the PA has no way to tell ordinary Palestinians that they have a path to an independent state. The unchecked growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, pogroms by Israeli settlers, and the open contempt many members of Netanyahu’s coalition have for Palestinians all increase the PA’s humiliation. Abbas himself is 87 years old and inspires little love among Palestinians. When he finally moves on, chaos may engulf the PA, with Hamas further increasing its influence.\nFor ordinary Palestinians, especially those who are not in the line of fire, Hamas’s attack may come with some sense of satisfaction, showing that Israelis will pay a price if they ignore Palestinian rights. Skepticism of peace talks and of Israeli intentions was high among Palestinians before the latest fighting. As a result, the PA, in public, will continue to criticize Israel, especially as large numbers of Palestinians die in the Israeli response, even though it hopes that Israel will crush Hamas and that the organization will be even weaker.\n\n3. The attack represents a massive Israeli intelligence failure.\nAlthough tensions had been high for some time, with warnings of a Third Intifada common, the scale of this attack caught Israel, as well as outside observers, by surprise. Israeli officials are already saying this was a massive intelligence failure.\nTactically, Israel was not prepared for Hamas’s ability to infiltrate fighters across the border and otherwise conduct a large-scale operation under Israel’s nose. The attack was also a surprise strategically, with Israel not prepared for such a dramatic escalation in fighting. And the timing of the attack will only compound the embarrassment, as it occurred almost to the day of the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack that began the 1973 Arab-Israeli War—perhaps the biggest intelligence failure in Israel’s history.\nUndoubtedly, investigations into this intelligence failure will seek answers as to why Israel’s famously skilled security services were caught by surprise. One reason may be a degree of complacency on the part of Israeli leaders. The Palestinian issue seemed to be successfully managed for many years, with Israel’s strong response to any flare-ups ensuring that Hamas quickly sought negotiations. Iron Dome and other systems seem to effectively protect Israelis from rockets and mortars from Gaza, while the barrier along the border with Gaza meant infiltration was seemingly impossible.\nIsraelis may also have underestimated Hamas’s counterintelligence, believing that the group would not learn from its past failures. Yet observers have long warned that the Palestinian situation was boiling over and that an unrepentant Hamas was seeking to turn the tables on Israel.\nThe attack—with its high number of dead and wounded as well as numerous hostages—also represents a major failure for the Netanyahu government. This is a particular problem in the Israeli political context, as Netanyahu has sold himself as a politician who can lead the fight against terrorism, force the Palestinians to bend to his will, and be tough on security.\nThe fighting comes at a time when Netanyahu is facing other significant challenges. His efforts to greatly weaken the power of Israel’s Supreme Court led to mass protests, and he himself has been indicted for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. He has a core of supporters, but he cannot afford damage to his security credentials. In addition, he relies on an extreme right-wing government, with several openly racist ministers who have long called for tougher treatment of the Palestinians, especially when violence occurs.\n\n4. The hostage drama will dramatically complicate the situation.\nIn addition to the high death toll, one of the hardest things for Israel to handle will be the hostages whom Hamas has taken. In the past, Israel had bargained for years to return its people—and even their dead bodies—in the possession of its enemies. In 2011, for example, the Netanyahu government exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in 2006.\nThe hostages Hamas has taken will be powerful bargaining chips, as they give Hamas the option to respond to Israeli military action by threatening to harm or actually harming or killing the hostages. The hostages’ presence in Gaza also puts countervailing pressures on Israeli political and military leaders. The attack has already triggered a large-scale military response, but retrieving the hostages alive will be more likely with smaller-scale actions such as negotiations or special forces operations.\n\n5. Expect a tough Israeli response.\nIsrael’s initial response has involved targeting Hamas rocket and missile facilities in Gaza as well as trying to round up Hamas infiltrators and prevent additional militants from entering Israel—a daunting set of tasks.\nIsrael will try to restore shreds of deterrence by showing Hamas that it will pay a heavy price for its actions. For now, the attack on Israel will be seen by many Israelis and Palestinians as a win for Hamas. Because the Palestinian group is so much weaker than Israel, its ability to strike—and with such deadly effect—is impressive, even if the Israeli response in the end is far more devastating. Israel prioritizes deterrence, not only to stop Hamas from attacking but also to counter Hezbollah, Iran, and other adversaries, as its leaders believe that weakness on one front spreads to other areas.\nWhen Israel fought Hezbollah in 2006, Hezbollah’s continued attacks and killing of more than 100 Israelis sent the message that the group could inflict serious harm on Israel, even if in the end Hezbollah and Lebanon suffered far more. Israel has struggled for years to restore deterrence against Hamas and continues to worry—with good reason—that it is falling short.\nIn addition to punishing airstrikes, the Israeli response may involve significant actions on the ground in Gaza. In the past, Israel has rightly regarded ground operations with caution despite calls by some Israeli leaders to deal with the Hamas problem once and for all. In the past, the more limited nature of the conflict allowed cautious leaders such as Netanyahu to stick to economic pressure and air attacks, minimizing the risk to Israeli soldiers.\nThe scale of Hamas’s latest attack, however, creates enormous pressure for Israel to try to root out the organization from Gaza—an almost impossible task given Hamas’s deep economic, religious, and social base there. At the very least, Israeli leaders will feel pressure to show successes, such as the deaths or arrests of senior Hamas leaders, as well as other visible, and visceral, signs that Israel is striking back. Hamas will be hit hard in the end, and ordinary Gazans will surely pay a heavy price.\n",

        "article": "TEARS FOR UKRAINE, SANCTIONS FOR RUSSIA, YAWNS FOR YEMEN, ARMS FOR SAUDIS: THE WEST’S GROTESQUE DOUBLE STANDARD\n\n“We’re brutally bombed every day. So why doesn’t the Western world care like it does about Ukraine?!!… Is it because we don’t have blonde hair and blue eyes like Ukrainians?” Ahmed Tamri, a Yemeni father of four, asked with furrowed brows about the outpouring of international support and media coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the lack of such a reaction to the war in Yemen.\nOver the weekend, a member of Tamri’s family was killed and nine relatives injured when their family home was targeted in a Saudi-led Coalition airstrike in the remote al-Saqf area in Hajjah Governorate. Tamri claims that al-Saqf has been subjected to a brutal Saudi bombing campaign for the past seven years – more so, he says, than all of Ukraine has endured since it was invaded by Russia.\nDespite the horrific bombing campaign against Yemeni civilians, Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations and war crimes have garnered nowhere near the level of coverage and sympathy that the mainstream Western media has rightfully given to Ukraine. “They shed tears for the Ukrainians, and ignore our tragedies… What hypocrisy and racism!” Tamri told MintPress News.\n\nYemenis ask the obvious\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues into the sixth day, an outpouring of support for Ukrainians continues to be seen across the Western world. Severe sanctions against Russia have been imposed by the United States, Europe, Australia, and the West in general, amid a flurry of emergency talks at the UN Security Council. The speed of Western retaliation – which includes banning Russia from the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) international banking network and calls to treat Russians as international pariahs in sports, culture, and even science – has raised eyebrows among Yemenis who have endured a relentless bombing campaign and deadly air, land, and sea blockade for 2,520 consecutive days.\nSince Thursday, when Russian forces began their wide-ranging assault on Ukraine, the Saudi-led Coalition, supported by the United States, has launched more airstrikes in Yemen than Russia has in Ukraine. In Hajjah, a province surrounded by heavy Saudi artillery, Saudi-led coalition warplanes launched more than 150 airstrikes on the cities of Haradh, Heiraan, Abbs, and Mustab, killing scores of civilians, including a father of six killed over the weekend by a Saudi drone that targeted his car as it traveled between Shafar and the Khamis Al-Wahat market.\nSince Russia’s incursion into Ukraine began, dozens of civilians, including a number of African migrants, have been killed and hundreds wounded by Saudi artillery and airstrikes in Yemen’s heavily populated Saada province, declared a military area by Saudi Arabia at the start of its military campaign in March 2015.\nAs news cameras and solidarity protests gave much-needed sympathy to Ukrainian civilians, in Sana’a, Yemen – which has effectively been turned into a large prison for the city’s more than four million residents and refugees, thanks to a crippling Saudi blockade – warplanes bombed a number of densely populated areas, including the airport. An additional 160 airstrikes were launched on the provinces of Marib, al-Jawf, al-Baydha, Taiz, Najran, and Hodeida, the main entry point for commercial goods and aid into a country facing the worst man-made famine in the 21st century.\nIn fact, it seems as though the Saudi regime is taking advantage of a distracted media in order to escalate attacks on a number of sensitive targets along the Yemen-Saudi border and strengthen its hold over the Al-Mahra Governorate. The UAE, the other major Western-backed oil monarchy occupying Yemen, is likewise making hay, accelerating its project to change the demographics on the prized Socotra Island by displacing locals in favor of settlers more aligned with UAE policies. And while the U.S. readies massive shipments of arms and military aid to Ukrainian “freedom fighters” defending against a Russian invasion, Yemeni “rebels” downed an American-made MQ9-1 drone flown by the UAE in al-Jawf and two American-made Boeing Insitu ScanEagles in Marib and Hajjah.\nAs countries that have spent the past decades building literal and figurative walls to keep out desperate brown and black refugees fleeing violence and foreign invasion in their own lands open their arms, homes, and hearts to fleeing Ukrainian refugees, Saudi Arabia unleashed a force of Yemeni mercenaries upon their homeland with a promise of a Saudi green card and safety for their families if they turn on their fellow countrymen. Ironically named the “Happy Yemen Forces,” the unit was finalized in late 2021, according to leaked military documents, with a mandate to secure Saudi Arabia’s border with Yemen and ensure Saudi security in exchange for a green card and access to the Saudi social services that come with it.\n\nIf we are to compare\nIn terms of the sheer cost of human life, the tragedy in Yemen has been much more deadly than that in Ukraine, where 325 Ukrainians, including 14 children have tragically lost their lives according to Ukrainian officials. Granted the war in Yemen has raged on unabated for more than six years, but comparatively the numbers are astonishing. Since 2015 the death toll has reached an estimated 400,000 people, including 3,900 children.\nThose deaths have included attacks on civilians so egregious that they did garner fleeting media attention but, inevitably, no sanctions, little international condemnation, not even a cessation in the military aid and support to the perpetrators. Bombed-out schools, funerals, wedding halls, refugee camps, even a school bus full of children targeted by the most advanced U.S. weaponry on offer have not been sufficient to elicit the reaction that Ukraine has garnered in less than one week.\nSince 2015, Saudi-led Coalition warplanes have pounded Yemen with over 266,000 airstrikes, according to the Yemeni Army Operations Room, which records airstrikes against civilian and military targets. Seventy percent of those strikes have hit civilian targets. The rising smoke, rubble and flames now seen in Ukraine have been the status quo in Yemen for years, with Western media often deeming the images that appear on local Yemeni television stations, of parents pulling pieces of their children out from the rubble of their homes or schools, too graphic to display.\nThousands of Yemen’s economically vital facilities like factories, food storage facilities, fishing boats, food markets and fuel tankers have been bombed by the Western-backed Saudi Coalition. Critical infrastructure – including airports, seaports, electrical stations, water tanks, roads and bridges and countless more schools, agricultural fields, and places of worship – have been destroyed or damaged. A Saudi blockade and airstrikes on hospitals have crippled Yemen’s health system, leaving it unable to deal with even the most basic public health needs and leaving the 300 facilities that remain in the entire country barely functioning as COVID-19 spreads like wildfire.\nAs the outpourings of condemnation of Russia’s invasion continue, Western governments have sent massive aid packages to Ukraine and social media campaigns fill in the gaps – while in Yemen the United Nations announced that by March it would likely cut aid to 8 million people in a country that it calls home to the worst humanitarian crisis on earth. Household food insecurity in Yemen hovers at over 80%. Almost one-third of the population does not have enough food to satisfy even basic nutritional needs. Underweight and stunted children have become a regular sight and the worst is yet to come, as the Russian invasion has led to increased fuel and food prices and as humanitarian funding dries up, according to the UN World Food Programme.\n\nPicking and choosing which invasion to condemn\nIn March 2015, more than 17 countries led by the oil-rich monarchy of Saudi Arabia launched a military invasion of Yemen, a sovereign state and a member of the United Nations. Ostensibly, the war was launched to restore President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to power after he was ousted following popular protests amid the Arab Spring.\nBy March 26 of that year, the Saudi-led Coalition, backed militarily and diplomatically by the United States, would begin a bombing campaign that has indiscriminately killed, maimed, and destroyed for seven years. Not only has Saudi Arabia, arguably the most repressive dictatorship on earth, forced Hadi back into power under the guise of protecting democracy, but it has also occupied huge swaths of southern Yemen from al-Mahara to the Bab al-Mandab Strait.\nYemeni journalists, activists and politicians have been left to ponder why Western governments – in particular, the Biden administration – condemn Russia for invading Ukraine under the pretext of national security while defending the Saudi regime’s “legitimate right” to invade Yemen under the very same pretext.\nDespite the horrific human rights violations carried out by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, Western nations, and the United States in particular, have not only provided lethal weapons, training, maintenance, intelligence, and political and diplomatic cover to the monarchy but have imposed media restrictions on coverage of the Saudi regime’s human rights abuses in Yemen, pressuring tech and social media companies to deplatform and outright ban Yemeni activists and media critical of the war.\nAs mainstream Western media gives glowing coverage to Ukrainians resisting their foreign invaders and occupiers – with Western leaders applauding the steadfastness and resistance of Ukrainians and sending aid, weapons and moral support to them – they label Yemenis taking up arms as terrorists and target them with American-made smart bombs and drone attacks. Yemenis who take up arms against invading Saudi and Emirati forces are sanctioned and dismissed as proxies of Iran by liberal media institutions that claim to stand against war.\nOn Monday, the United Nations Security Council extended an arms embargo and travel ban on Yemeni forces. The resolution strongly condemned what it called cross-border attacks by the “Houthis,” a derogatory term used to refer to Ansar Allalh, the single largest force challenging the Saudi invasion and occupation. It went on to condemn “attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates” referring to Ansar Allah’s missile and drone attacks on Saudi-led Coalition airports and oil storage facilities.\nCommenting on the resolution – which came as the UAE refused to publicly condemn Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, hoping to gain Russian backing for its own invasion of Yemen – Ansar Allah leader Mohammed al-Houthi made one simple request: that Saudi Arabia’s deliberate targeting of civilians in Yemen lead to a Saudi weapons ban. Essentially, al-Houthi asked for a lifting of double standards, apparently an impossible request in today’s political climate.",

        "article": "Could We See A Ukraine-Russia Phony War?\n\nNews coming from the battlefield in Ukraine has seen a shift in the descriptions of the military situation since the beginning of the war. If we remember, analysts were then describing what appeared to be the technological superiority of the Ukrainian armed forces thanks to the support of Western allies and NATO in particular. Today, we look at the situation and the same analysts compare it to one of the most horrific aspects of the First World War: trench warfare. This is basically the cancellation of any technological superiority on either side and a return to hand-to-hand combat. It is a return to the time of cannon fodder, as it was described during the First World War.\nAlthough it dates back to at least the 17th century, trench warfare is a symbol of the First World War. These trenches embody an incomprehensible reality of horror. They were narrow, muddy corridors, marked by biting cold, the incessant threat of artillery bombardment and omnipresent unburied corpses. This evokes a world of absolute violence and cruelty, which is what the front looks like in Ukraine today.\nAccording to Francois Cochet of the Museum of the Great War in France, soldiers were immersed in a constant state of anxiety in the face of the possibility of sudden death from enemy shells, while coexisting with rats and lice. The deafening noise of explosions punctuated their daily lives. The trenches not only symbolize the brutality of war, but also the physical and mental exhaustion of the fighters, compelled to survive in dehumanizing conditions where the simple act of living takes on an unbearable dimension, turning every moment into a terrifying struggle for survival.\nThe current situation on the front in Ukraine, which also evokes a clear stalemate situation, raises many questions, especially on the role of countries in the West in terms of supporting Ukraine and how to move forward. As President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to travel the capitals of the world urging military and financial support, this clearly outlines that the decision of whether to continue or stop the war lies in the hands of politicians in Washington and Europe.\nOn that matter, the domestic political landscape also resembles trench warfare. We can plainly see the divide among politicians between those supporting Ukraine and those who want an end to the war. This is particularly true in the US, where the divide has largely been between Democrats’ continuous support and a majority of Republicans stating that this support, in a time of economic challenges, must stop.\nAs the US enters a presidential election year and the Ukrainian file is somewhat overshadowed by the situation in Gaza, it is without doubt a crucial time. As the conflict gets bogged down and with no achievements on the ground for Ukrainian troops, it is clear that Russia can bear this deathtrap status quo much better than Ukraine, which is now completely dependent on Western support. This forces politicians, who now realize that their promises of Moscow collapsing are becoming a distant mirage, to reposition their stances. As domestic files put pressure on the outcome of elections, there is a greater chance of Kyiv facing increasing pressure to sit at the negotiating table and find a deal. This would mean an end to the war via a long-lasting ceasefire and an acceptance by Ukraine of a direct loss, but without announcing it.\nThe other scenario would be to recalibrate the support to help Kyiv cope with this stalemate situation. This implies an economic revival of the country while controlling the intensity of the conflict on the front lines. This would be reminiscent of the Second World War’s “phony war” — the state of watchful waiting and almost no confrontations between France and the UK’s declaration of war on Nazi Germany on Sept. 3, 1939, and the German offensive on May 10, 1940. This would mean leaving the wound open while waiting for a decisive way to change the situation on the front line. Who would benefit the most? We could easily see how Moscow would be better capable of using this situation to its advantage. Yet, it would also save face for Western politicians.\nBeyond these questions, one can start to see that, since the end of the Cold War and now with the renewed great power competition, Europe has been unable to develop a long-term unified strategy vis-a-vis Moscow. This is what is still lacking today. The great unity in support of Ukraine cannot be defined as a strategy in the context of geopolitical competition. Moreover, focusing solely on economic interests, like Germany did, does not work. There needs to be a more comprehensive approach.\nThe reality is that, if we look into Europe’s domestic politics, we are back in the trenches. There is an entire spectrum that advocates opposing Russia in all shapes and forms and another that promotes the establishment of a full alignment of interests. Election cycles continue to move from one to the next and from one country to another and will continue weakening the European stance.\nIt is clear that, regardless of what happens, we are moving toward a shift in the support Ukraine receives from Western countries. The most probable outcome is to give Ukraine the possibility of getting out of the trenches. However, leaving this wound open would increase the risk of the war suddenly expanding to the rest of Europe.",

Just last week, Medvedev warned that Moscow would hit Ukraine with a nuclear strike if Kiev attacked missile launch sites on Russian territory.\nOn Wednesday he wrote that “the existence of Ukraine is life-threatening for Ukrainians.”\nMedvedev emphasized that he was talking not only about the current political regime in the country, but about “every, absolutely every form of Ukraine.”\n“Why? The existence of an independent state on the historic Russian territories will now be a constant pretext for the resumption of hostilities,” Medvedev said. “No matter who is at the forefront of the cancerous growth under the name of Ukraine, this will not give legitimacy to their rule and the legal viability of the ‘country’ itself.”\nHe continued: “Therefore, the likelihood of a new fight will remain indefinitely. Almost always. “In addition, there is a 100 percent chance of a new conflict, regardless of what security papers the West signs with the puppet regime in Kiev.”\nNewsweek emailed Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday seeking comment.\nAccording to Medvedev, this threat of future war would not be averted even if Ukraine joined the European Union or NATO.\n“It could happen in 10 years or 50 years,” he said of another possible conflict.\nThe Kremlin official went on to say that Ukrainians are “at the end of the day a practical people” who will realize that the existence of Ukraine’s statehood is “fatal” for them.\nMedvedev said that because of this, “the vast majority of Ukrainians (well, perhaps with the exception of a minimal number of frozen nationalists) will ultimately choose life when choosing between eternal war and inevitable death and life.”\nThe former president wrote that most Ukrainians would rather live in a larger version of Russia than face eternal war, even if they “wish death for the Russians now” and “hate the Russian leadership.”\n“They will understand that life in a large community state, which they no longer like so much, is better than death,” he said. “Her death and the death of her loved ones. And the sooner Ukrainians realize this, the better.”\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly stated that not only will his country not capitulate to Russia, but that he will not agree to peace negotiations that would allow Russia to retain Ukrainian territory it conquers in the war started by Putin has in February 2022.",

        "article": "Ukraine war, European dependence on Russian oil and gas prove ESG is a threat to national security\n\nOne of the facts being laid bare by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is that Europe has become highly dependent on Russian oil and natural gas for its economy, largely owing to green energy policies that have shut down coal and nuclear electricity generation in countries like Germany, thereby necessitating the importation of Russian natural gas through pipelines like Nordstream 1 that runs from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea.\nIn 2020, the European Union imported 9.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to Eurostat. And about 41 percent Europe’s imports come from Russia, or about 3.73 trillion cubic feet a year, 24 percent from Norway at 2.2 trillion cubic feet and 11 percent from Algeria at 1 trillion.\nThe Nord Stream 2 was suspended by Germany because of the war and was built from 2018 and finished construction in Sept. 2021 at a cost of $11 billion, and would have doubled the current pipeline’s distribution of 1.9 trillion cubic feet a year to 3.9 trillion cubic feet a year. In Nov. 2021, Germany delayed final regulatory approval of the pipeline project before the war. Germany already purchases about 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia before the new pipeline has even gone online.\nWestern dependence on Russian oil and gas as a main source has absolutely become a threat to national security to everyone paying attention. Now, after the invasion, Germany realizes the threat and is building two new liquified natural gas terminals to take in more imports, and is increasing military spending. They are pivoting.\nBut independence will not happen overnight. Germany is still so dependent on Russian oil and gas that German Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters on March 1 that Berlin opposes an embargo on Russian energy imports: “I wouldn’t support an embargo on imports of fossil fuels from Russia… I would even speak out against it, because we would threaten the social peace in the republic with that.”\nPresident Joe Biden announced new sanctions on Russia, and is releasing 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but like Germany is also holding back on an embargo or even on more drilling. Is the U.S. lagging behind?\nIn a recent Morning Consult poll conducted on behalf of the American Petroleum institute on March 1, 84 percent of Americans agreed, with 63 percent strongly agreeing, with the statement “Producing natural gas and oil here in the U.S. helps make our country and allies more secure against actions by other countries such as Russia.” That included 88 percent of Republicans, 83 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of independents.\nWhat is less obvious to voters is that federal energy policy goes way beyond easy-to-understand permits allowing drilling on federal lands or agreements with Canada authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline to be built. And these other policies play a far more influential role in hampering energy policy not just for the U.S., but advanced economies throughout the West.\nThe federal government the past seven years has opened the door for left-wing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing via private retirement funds regulated under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) via a regulation by the Obama Labor Department in 2015.\nThe Obama rule allowed pension plan managers to give additional weight to companies touting ESG goals that focus on green energy, cleaning up the environment, are anti-oil, anti-coal, anti-carbon, but also anti-tobacco, anti-guns, embracing critical race theory, implementing diversity and inclusion racial and gender hiring quotas and practices and other left-wing issues.\nSuffice to say, having a high ESG rating gives a company weighted investments in ESG funds—and for companies focused on green energy at the expense of oil and coal, it has paid off handsomely, even while U.S. energy independence and security has suffered.\nFinancial incentives like this are why in part stocks like Tesla have recently rallied to more than $1,100 per share before the market’s recent correction despite not generating much profits for years, because they are weighted so heavily by ESG funds. With ESG investing, profits are divorced from valuation and saving the world takes precedence.\nBig ESG funds like BlackRock, a hedge fund with more than $9 trillion of assets under management, have placed green activists onto the board of Exxon to make it a “not-oil” company. And so forth.\nUnder President Joe Biden the $762 billion federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for federal employee retirees will be investing in ESG funds as well going into effect in 2022, following state government employee retirement funds in California, New York, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland and Oregon that have made similar investments for years. Those are tax dollars, paid into government employee retirement plans going directly to funding green energy, at the expense of particularly oil and coal.\nThanks to the combination of incentives and direct funds, ESG funds, which total $38 trillion out more than $100 trillion global assets under management, will grow to $53 trillion by 2025, according to Bloomberg News. And it will crush carbon-based energy, hampering the West economically and militarily by limiting options in the event of war.\nThe whole point of ESG is to restrict capital investment from flowing into proven carbon-based energies that the West now urgently needs, which is exactly what happened to Europe and the UK — and now Russia has them over a barrel. Congress should consider prohibiting the use of federal funds, including pensions, for implementing the ESG regulation incentivizing green investment at the expense of carbon-based energy including oil and coal.\nNow, even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose company’s market cap has increased by hundreds of billions of dollars because of ESG investing is calling for more oil and drilling, writing on Twitter on March 4: “Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil & gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures… Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports.\nESG is neutering the West, endangering national security and emboldening our adversaries by making the U.S. and Europe increasingly dependent on Russia.\nIn a world at war, energy independence equals sovereign freedom and independence. The question is: Does the West still want to be free? If so, then it’s time to drill — and to defund ESG.",

And this is clearly a genocide,\" Zelenskyy said, reiterating that hatred against one country \"never stops\" and that Russia will continue its campaign to other countries if it succeeds in Ukraine.\n\"Parts of Moldova and Georgia remain occupied,\" he said. \"Russia tore Syria into ruins, and if not Russia, the chemical weapons would have never been used there in Syria.\"\n\"Russia has almost swallowed Belarus,\" he continued. \"It is obviously threatening Kazakhstan and other Baltic States, and the goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our lands, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you – again, the international rules-based order.\"\n\"Many seats in the U.N. General Assembly Hall may become empty if Russia succeeds with its treachery and aggression,\" he stressed.\nRussia gets its chance to address the General Assembly on Saturday when Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is expected on the rostrum. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky sat in Russia’s seat during Zelenskyy’s speech.",

        "article": "Gutknecht: Time for tough questions about Ukraine\n\nBefore we dive deeper into the boiling waters of the conflict between Ukraine and its Russian cousins, some tough questions need to be asked.\n\nJust before the battle of Manassas, Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Pope Walker famously claimed that he would be able to wipe up the blood spilled with his pocket-handkerchief.\nHe was wrong.\nNo one could have predicted that when the United States first sent advisors and military aid to South Viet Nam that it would lead to such a long and expensive (in both blood and treasure) war. A war that ended with an American withdrawal and a Communist victory. But that’s what happened.\nMuch the same can be said of our vain attempts to save Afghanistan from a virulent strain of militant Islam.\nHistory is replete with political and military miscalculations. The tragic costs of those mistakes are borne by ordinary people, especially by the young. Before we dive deeper into the boiling waters of the conflict between Ukraine and its Russian cousins, some tough questions need to be asked.\nThe first and perhaps most uncomfortable question is why. Why did Putin decide to advance diplomatic and political ends by military means? The smart guys in this administration (the ones still advancing the lie of Russian collusion) claim that Putin is just an evil warmonger. Maybe. But stupid he is not. Could it be that he meant it when he said that he would never allow Ukraine to join NATO and have American missiles positioned 100 miles from Moscow? Someone should be asking what our courting of Ukrainian membership into NATO contributed to the commencement of hostilities. Was that such a good idea?\nWhy are Americans being asked to foot the lion’s share of the costs for this proxy war? What of our European allies? This is in their neighborhood after all. Remember the ones who, after much gnashing of teeth, promised to pay their share for their defense? Their contributions are so far … pathetic. According to a report in the Telegraph, shortly after Russia launched the invasion, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged an extra €100 billion to bolster the German military, opening a “new era” in which they would do “whatever necessary” to defend NATO’s borders. At this writing, NONE of that money has been appropriated. All while our president is eager to throw another $30+ billion (that we don’t have) into the fire. Are we saps? Does anyone believe we will ever get an accounting of where our grandchildren’s money went? The gas company that bought protection from the Biden family isn’t the only corrupt enterprise in Ukraine.\nWhy are we underwriting a war that is killing so many on both sides and destroying Ukraine? Is it so that Zelensky can join NATO and be invited to strut at swank events like Davos? Who will bear the burden of rebuilding the country? If you don’t know the answer to that one you may stop reading.\nAnother question that almost no one has asked is, what is the end game? Do our pompous Pentagon patriarchs believe that Ukraine can defeat Russia? Remember their hollow promises of progress in Afghanistan? Their track record of over-promising is there for all to see.\nTo hopefully prevent an escalation, the rules of engagement guarantee that all fighting and destruction will occur on Ukrainian soil. That sounds like a limited war doesn’t it? Our experience with limited wars isn’t good. The brave young Ukrainians have heroically fought the Russians to a standstill thus far. Will the Russians turn tail or simply pull back to regroup and launch an even more aggressive offensive? Remember Hitler thought he had the Russians by the tail with a downhill pull. It didn’t end well.\nWhat if a desperate Putin decides to escalate and make strikes on Poland and other countries providing military aid? What is our contingency plan if the Russians begin to wear down the Ukrainians and are marching on to Kyiv? Or, what if the Chinese, seeing that we are otherwise distracted and running low on high-tech weapons, decide to move on to Taiwan? What then?\nA wounded bear is far more dangerous than a healthy one. Longer term, do we want to push the Russians into a closer alliance with China and Iran? How does that benefit our security interests?\nThese are difficult and uncomfortable questions. But they need to be asked and answered by our policymakers. These matters deserve sober consideration before we wind up in a nuclear confrontation or commit to another long, bloody, and expensive limited war. Perhaps now is the perfect time for some back-channel negotiations. The worst thing that could happen is that they might fail. The sense is that both sides are growing war-weary. Americans are as well.",

        "article": "Western Leaders Disregard Zelensky's Murderous Attack on Donetsk\n\nThe death toll from Ukraine's January 21 shelling of a market in Donetsk has soared to 27. The attack – slammed by Moscow as a barbaric terrorist act against Russia's civilian population - left 25 more injured.\n\nWestern leaders have remained tight-lipped on the Kiev regime’s deadly terrorist attack against Donetsk on Sunday, with many mainstream media headlines only mentioning the very fact of the event without singling out who was behind the tragedy.\nOn Sunday, Ukrainian troops shelled Donetsk’s Kirovsky district, a busy area with markets and shops, which are full of people, especially on weekends. It left 27 civilians killed and 25 more injured.\nThe BBC went so far as to cite a “Ukrainian army group operating in the region” as saying that they “did not carry out the attack” – despite the fact that Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, confirmed that Ukrainian troops used 152mm and 155mm artillery systems during the shelling.\nCBS News and Fox News, in turn, preferred not to report on the attack at all.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was the only official who decisively denounced Ukraine’s shelling attack on Donetsk.\n\"The secretary-general strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk, which reportedly killed at least 25 people and injured more than 20 others,\" a spokesperson for the UN chief said on Sunday.\nGuterres stressed that \"Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately.\"\nHe was echoed by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov who told reporters that Russia strongly condemns the attack, and that the special military operation “naturally will continue in order to protect our people from this danger.\" He denounced the shelling as a \"monstrous act of terrorism, as weapons were used indiscriminately.\"\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry, for its part, slammed the attack as \"a barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia,\" urging international organizations and national governments to condemn the shelling. According to the ministry’s statement, any “silence will mean unspoken approval of the massacre of civilians.”\nThe ministry added that “Kiev's terrorist attacks clearly demonstrate its lack of political will to reach a peace settlement through diplomatic means.”\nHowever, the collective West is no less responsible for this terrorist attack since it has the “desire to inflict a strategic defeat on the Russian Federation using Ukrainian puppets,\" a desire that has pushed Kiev to take even more “reckless steps”, including “terrorist acts, mass violation of international humanitarian law and war crimes,” the statement pointed out.\nThe ministry underscored that the Ukrainian Army used Western weaponry during the shelling, which “once again confirms its [the West’s] direct involvement in the conflict and makes it a partner in the crimes of the Zelensky regime's atrocities.\"\nAccording to the statement, in the light of the Donetsk shelling, the necessity to implement the goals of the special military operation become even more evident since “Ukrainian territory must not be a source of security threats” and a platform for terrorist acts.\nShelling the Donetsk region and targeting civilian areas is not uncommon for the Kiev regime, which has killed at least 9,152 civilians, including 233 children, in the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk since May 2014, according to the Joint Center for Control and Coordination (JCCC) of issues related to Ukraine's war crimes.",

For Kiev, such a belief might actually be genuine, he suggested.\n“Regarding the Ukrainian leadership, I would not be able to tell. I have a guess that President Zelensky himself is, basically, delusional and has become drunk on his own rhetoric as well as the flattery that he used to receive from the West. I think it has really deranged him a bit and disturbed his relationship to reality,” the RT.com contributor suggested.\nIn the West, the understanding that such a goal is not viable has become more prominent, and talk of continuous support for Ukraine is, at least partially, a “negotiation tactic,” the professor argued.\n“Concerning the West, my guess is that quite a few people in Washington and in the EU as well understand that they have to get out of this war without a Russian defeat. Now do they understand already how much they have to concede? Again, I can’t tell,” Amar stated.\nWestern decision makers, particularly in the US, apparently still “live in the 1990s” and refuse to realize that the age of “unilateralism” is over. The Russian leadership, as well as China and Iran, live in the present, Amar claimed.\nWithout Western interference, the conflict between Kiev and Moscow would have never started, and multiple opportunities to bring it to an end were deliberately sabotaged, including the Minsk agreement of 2015 and the Istanbul talks of March 2022, Amar said.\n“The roots of the war do really go to 2008, the infamous Bucharest summit, when both Georgia and Ukraine were put by the West into this insane position of saying’ One day you’ll be in NATO, but not now,’ which, of course, exposed them and made them threats for Russia.”\nThe West’s insistence on fueling the conflict largely stems from two ideas, Amar explained. The West “simply won’t give up on its idea of expanding NATO, which in itself is an insane idea,” as well as pursues a “long-term geopolitical strategy of getting Russia down,” as it refused to accept Moscow’s resurgence following the 1990s turmoil.",

The FAA has been watching Dementia Joe Biden fly the United States directly into the ground for three years and decided to do for civil aviation what the White House has done for peace and prosperity. Nothing better reflects a “crash and burn” leadership style than elevating unqualified people into positions where they can do the most harm. It’s worked for the West Wing, the Pentagon, and the Treasury Department! Why not for the agency responsible for air traffic control and passenger safety? What could possibly go wrong?\nOh, sure, perhaps flyers will die more frequently in fiery collisions or when unbolted aircraft doors shoot off into the clouds, but at least they will leave this mortal coil knowing that the people who build and pilot consumer aircraft represent such an amazing infusion of “diversity” that even the dumbest and most temperamentally unstable among us have been “included” in the life-and-death trust exercise of not falling out of the sky. That’s what real “equity” requires — redistributing the earned responsibilities of those who have demonstrated merit and commitment to those who have demonstrated mediocrity and unreliability. It’s why the globalists’ forced DEI standard (diversity, equity, and inclusion — barf!) across the public and private sectors should be more accurately returned to DIE — because wherever the deadly acronym dilutes excellence, living safely becomes less likely.\nCome to think of it, Joe Biden is DIE’s perfect mascot. Angry, confused, and incompetent Old Joe is the Chief Dolt and Grand Pooh-bah of an ass-backward system where the least capable in society thrive.\nGiven the U.S. government’s love affair with censorship and propaganda, I sometimes imagine future historians piecing through the shards of Western civilization in order to understand the reasons for its collapse. According to the prevailing “narrative,” everything right now is tremendously great! We are told that the economy is strong, that crime is under control, that our borders are secure, that paying twenty bucks for a fast-food hamburger is cheap, and that endless war produces endless peace. According to the news media, Americans have never had it so good! How then, third-millennium anthropologists might wonder, did everything go kaput so quickly?\nWell, hopefully, someone in the future will stumble across a time capsule with Joe Biden’s linguistically challenged press conference from the other day, in which he angrily denounced the Potemkin special counsel’s legal conclusion that, while Decrepit Joe committed federal crimes damaging to America’s national security, he is nevertheless too senile to prosecute. “The alleged ‘president’ of the allegedly ‘most powerful nation’ in the world betrayed his country, was too incompetent to stand trial, but remained perfectly competent to run for re-election?” some future human chronicler might ask before letting out a high-pitched, “Eureka! Now I get why everything died suddenly!”\n“Died suddenly” might just become the catchall epithet (or maybe epitaph) for our age. Right now the medical community continues to destroy what’s left of its reputation by refusing to connect the dots between increased rates of cancer and heart disease and the global rollout of the mostly mandated pharmaceutical injections not only falsely touted as cures to COVID, but also falsely labeled as “vaccines.” Every time a fourteen-year-old athlete “dies suddenly” on the gridiron or basketball court, the ethically compromised killers in white coats throw out all kinds of ludicrous explanations for why healthy young people are losing their lives. It was stress! It was red meat! It was racism! Or the increasingly ubiquitous it must have been climate change!\nIt’s funny, if not disturbing, to see all the people who changed their first name to “Doctor” struggle to reach the most obvious conclusion: that an experimental mRNA serum rushed to market without necessary testing or proper scrutiny might be to blame. Elementary school children with a rudimentary understanding of the Scientific Method and medical ethics would understand the potential harm from requiring healthy patients unlikely to die from COVID to nonetheless be “treated” with untested “vaccines.” Yet the “first, do no harm” swarm of group-thinkers, who have trouble realizing when pharmaceutical companies are using humans as guinea pigs to make billions in profits, jumped-to and insisted that the whole global population must be injected with possible poisons. Why would you experiment on anybody unless it was absolutely necessary (and then done only with informed consent)?\nWhy would you recklessly expand that experiment to the whole human race? Only the “scientific experts” could trip over such basic precepts of medical ethics on their way to creating a potential global catastrophe.\nYou would think that the same medical community that unwittingly conspired with evil pharmaceutical companies to hook millions of Americans on OxyContin and other opioids would have been more skeptical when magical COVID elixirs were quickly developed and marketed as cure-alls. Alas, the gullible are getting only more gullible. Perhaps this is why “climate change” is still the globalist boogeyman that haunts so many pliant imaginations around the world. The unscrupulous authorities who lied about the efficacy of lockdowns, masks, and experimental “vaccines” would never lie about “climate change,” right? What kind of monsters would tell the world that carbon is killing the planet if the science isn’t sound? Maybe the same globalist monsters who used COVID as a propaganda vehicle for establishing a “Great Reset” are also interested in using “climate change” hysteria to convince people that they must surrender their private property, privacy, and human rights in order to survive. Would an ethically challenged scientific community work with an even more ethically challenged political class to push a “climate change” hoax that justifies the erosion of individual liberties and the implementation of widespread communism prepackaged in an irrational fear of hydrocarbons? Duh, of course it would. When governments became the de facto funders of all academic research in the West, impartial, rigorous, and objective scientific inquiry “died suddenly,” too.\nIn the “died suddenly” era, authorities don’t seek truth; they seek politically convenient “narratives” that protect the entrenched power of the status quo. False “experts” fabricate false “realities” that serve as intellectual prisons for weak minds. The truly astounding thing is that some of today’s most “educated” people are the ones most susceptible to propaganda. Designer degrees reflect not a proven capacity for critical thinking, but rather a cerebral vulnerability to rigid programming.\nCase in point: the “trans” movement. Nowhere in human history has any society struggled with the biological distinctions separating men from women. Only in our absurd present age have the most credentialed twisted their neurons into such knots that they know less than those who never had a written language. One psychologist informed doctors at a medical convention that parents who do not believe that their “trans” children should be pumped full of sterilizing puberty-blockers or have their bodies mutilated are the ones with a “mental illness.” Increasingly, the “expert class” insists that people not suffering from psychological delusions are the ones who should be branded as delusional and dangerous.\nThis State-sanctioned “trans” insanity reminds me of a recent “diversity” exhibition in London that pushed the preposterous lie that “Britain was black for 7,000 years” before any white people arrived. For the academics involved, fraudulent history is good if it advances politically useful narratives. For everyone else, DIE-obsessed “experts” just look crazy.\nAt some point, a critical mass of people will reject a governing system overrun by misanthropes, lunatics, sadists, and liars. Populations do not obey those undeserving of respect. When respect for authorities “dies suddenly,” old orders will not survive.\n",
